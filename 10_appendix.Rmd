“It ought to make us feel ashamed when we talk like we know what we're talking about when we talk about love.”

“That's all we have, finally, the words, and they had better be the right ones.” 

“Get in, get out. Don't linger. Go on.” 

“There is no answer. It's okay. But even if it wasn't okay, what am I supposed to do?”

#### What We Talk About When We Talk About Love

The text we use is actually *Beginners*, or the unedited version. A drink is required in order to read it with the proper context. Probably several. No. Definitely several.
