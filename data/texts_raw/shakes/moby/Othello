SCENE I. Venice. A street.

Enter RODERIGO and IAGO


RODERIGO

Tush! never tell me; I take it much unkindlyThat thou, Iago, who hast had my purseAs if the strings were thine, shouldst know of this.

IAGO

'Sblood, but you will not hear me:If ever I did dream of such a matter, Abhor me.

RODERIGO

Thou told'st me thou didst hold him in thy hate.

IAGO

Despise me, if I do not. Three great ones of the city,In personal suit to make me his lieutenant,Off-capp'd to him: and, by the faith of man,I know my price, I am worth no worse a place:But he; as loving his own pride and purposes,Evades them, with a bombast circumstanceHorribly stuff'd with epithets of war;And, in conclusion,Nonsuits my mediators; for, 'Certes,' says he,'I have already chose my officer.'And what was he?Forsooth, a great arithmetician,One Michael Cassio, a Florentine,A fellow almost damn'd in a fair wife;That never set a squadron in the field,Nor the division of a battle knowsMore than a spinster; unless the bookish theoric,Wherein the toged consuls can proposeAs masterly as he: mere prattle, without practise,Is all his soldiership. But he, sir, had the election:And I, of whom his eyes had seen the proofAt Rhodes, at Cyprus and on other groundsChristian and heathen, must be be-lee'd and calm'dBy debitor and creditor: this counter-caster,He, in good time, must his lieutenant be,And I--God bless the mark!--his Moorship's ancient.

RODERIGO

By heaven, I rather would have been his hangman.

IAGO

Why, there's no remedy; 'tis the curse of service,Preferment goes by letter and affection,And not by old gradation, where each secondStood heir to the first. Now, sir, be judge yourself,Whether I in any just term am affinedTo love the Moor.

RODERIGO

I would not follow him then.

IAGO

O, sir, content you;I follow him to serve my turn upon him:We cannot all be masters, nor all mastersCannot be truly follow'd. You shall markMany a duteous and knee-crooking knave,That, doting on his own obsequious bondage,Wears out his time, much like his master's ass,For nought but provender, and when he's old, cashier'd:Whip me such honest knaves. Others there areWho, trimm'd in forms and visages of duty,Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves,And, throwing but shows of service on their lords,Do well thrive by them and when they have linedtheir coatsDo themselves homage: these fellows have some soul;And such a one do I profess myself. For, sir,It is as sure as you are Roderigo,Were I the Moor, I would not be Iago:In following him, I follow but myself;Heaven is my judge, not I for love and duty,But seeming so, for my peculiar end:For when my outward action doth demonstrateThe native act and figure of my heartIn compliment extern, 'tis not long afterBut I will wear my heart upon my sleeveFor daws to peck at: I am not what I am.

RODERIGO

What a full fortune does the thicklips oweIf he can carry't thus!

IAGO

Call up her father,Rouse him: make after him, poison his delight,Proclaim him in the streets; incense her kinsmen,And, though he in a fertile climate dwell,Plague him with flies: though that his joy be joy,Yet throw such changes of vexation on't,As it may lose some colour.

RODERIGO

Here is her father's house; I'll call aloud.

IAGO

Do, with like timorous accent and dire yellAs when, by night and negligence, the fireIs spied in populous cities.

RODERIGO

What, ho, Brabantio! Signior Brabantio, ho!

IAGO

Awake! what, ho, Brabantio! thieves! thieves! thieves!Look to your house, your daughter and your bags!Thieves! thieves!BRABANTIO appears above, at a window


BRABANTIO

What is the reason of this terrible summons?What is the matter there?

RODERIGO

Signior, is all your family within?

IAGO

Are your doors lock'd?

BRABANTIO

Why, wherefore ask you this?

IAGO

'Zounds, sir, you're robb'd; for shame, put onyour gown;Your heart is burst, you have lost half your soul;Even now, now, very now, an old black ramIs topping your white ewe. Arise, arise;Awake the snorting citizens with the bell,Or else the devil will make a grandsire of you:Arise, I say.

BRABANTIO

                  What, have you lost your wits?

RODERIGO

Most reverend signior, do you know my voice?

BRABANTIO

Not I	what are you?

RODERIGO

My name is Roderigo.

BRABANTIO

The worser welcome:I have charged thee not to haunt about my doors:In honest plainness thou hast heard me sayMy daughter is not for thee; and now, in madness,Being full of supper and distempering draughts,Upon malicious bravery, dost thou comeTo start my quiet.

RODERIGO

Sir, sir, sir,--

BRABANTIO

                  But thou must needs be sureMy spirit and my place have in them powerTo make this bitter to thee.

RODERIGO

Patience, good sir.

BRABANTIO

What tell'st thou me of robbing? this is Venice;My house is not a grange.

RODERIGO

Most grave Brabantio,In simple and pure soul I come to you.

IAGO

'Zounds, sir, you are one of those that will notserve God, if the devil bid you. Because we come todo you service and you think we are ruffians, you'llhave your daughter covered with a Barbary horse;you'll have your nephews neigh to you; you'll havecoursers for cousins and gennets for germans.

BRABANTIO

What profane wretch art thou?

IAGO

I am one, sir, that comes to tell you your daughterand the Moor are now making the beast with two backs.

BRABANTIO

Thou art a villain.

IAGO

You are--a senator.

BRABANTIO

This thou shalt answer; I know thee, Roderigo.

RODERIGO

Sir, I will answer any thing. But, I beseech you,If't be your pleasure and most wise consent,As partly I find it is, that your fair daughter,At this odd-even and dull watch o' the night,Transported, with no worse nor better guardBut with a knave of common hire, a gondolier,To the gross clasps of a lascivious Moor--If this be known to you and your allowance,We then have done you bold and saucy wrongs;But if you know not this, my manners tell meWe have your wrong rebuke. Do not believeThat, from the sense of all civility,I thus would play and trifle with your reverence:Your daughter, if you have not given her leave,I say again, hath made a gross revolt;Tying her duty, beauty, wit and fortunesIn an extravagant and wheeling strangerOf here and every where. Straight satisfy yourself:If she be in her chamber or your house,Let loose on me the justice of the stateFor thus deluding you.

BRABANTIO

Strike on the tinder, ho!Give me a taper! call up all my people!This accident is not unlike my dream:Belief of it oppresses me already.Light, I say! light!Exit above


IAGO

Farewell; for I must leave you:It seems not meet, nor wholesome to my place,To be produced--as, if I stay, I shall--Against the Moor: for, I do know, the state,However this may gall him with some cheque,Cannot with safety cast him, for he's embark'dWith such loud reason to the Cyprus wars,Which even now stand in act, that, for their souls,Another of his fathom they have none,To lead their business: in which regard,Though I do hate him as I do hell-pains.Yet, for necessity of present life,I must show out a flag and sign of love,Which is indeed but sign. That you shall surely find him,Lead to the Sagittary the raised search;And there will I be with him. So, farewell.Exit
Enter, below, BRABANTIO, and Servants with torches


BRABANTIO

It is too true an evil: gone she is;And what's to come of my despised timeIs nought but bitterness. Now, Roderigo,Where didst thou see her? O unhappy girl!With the Moor, say'st thou? Who would be a father!How didst thou know 'twas she? O she deceives mePast thought! What said she to you? Get more tapers:Raise all my kindred. Are they married, think you?

RODERIGO

Truly, I think they are.

BRABANTIO

O heaven! How got she out? O treason of the blood!Fathers, from hence trust not your daughters' mindsBy what you see them act. Is there not charmsBy which the property of youth and maidhoodMay be abused? Have you not read, Roderigo,Of some such thing?

RODERIGO

Yes, sir, I have indeed.

BRABANTIO

Call up my brother. O, would you had had her!Some one way, some another. Do you knowWhere we may apprehend her and the Moor?

RODERIGO

I think I can discover him, if you please,To get good guard and go along with me.

BRABANTIO

Pray you, lead on. At every house I'll call;I may command at most. Get weapons, ho!And raise some special officers of night.On, good Roderigo: I'll deserve your pains.Exeunt

SCENE II. Another street.

Enter OTHELLO, IAGO, and Attendants with torches


IAGO

Though in the trade of war I have slain men,Yet do I hold it very stuff o' the conscienceTo do no contrived murder: I lack iniquitySometimes to do me service: nine or ten timesI had thought to have yerk'd him here under the ribs.

OTHELLO

'Tis better as it is.

IAGO

Nay, but he prated,And spoke such scurvy and provoking termsAgainst your honourThat, with the little godliness I have,I did full hard forbear him. But, I pray you, sir,Are you fast married? Be assured of this,That the magnifico is much beloved,And hath in his effect a voice potentialAs double as the duke's: he will divorce you;Or put upon you what restraint and grievanceThe law, with all his might to enforce it on,Will give him cable.

OTHELLO

Let him do his spite:My services which I have done the signioryShall out-tongue his complaints. 'Tis yet to know,--Which, when I know that boasting is an honour,I shall promulgate--I fetch my life and beingFrom men of royal siege, and my demeritsMay speak unbonneted to as proud a fortuneAs this that I have reach'd: for know, Iago,But that I love the gentle Desdemona,I would not my unhoused free conditionPut into circumscription and confineFor the sea's worth. But, look! what lights come yond?

IAGO

Those are the raised father and his friends:You were best go in.

OTHELLO

Not I	I must be found:My parts, my title and my perfect soulShall manifest me rightly. Is it they?

IAGO

By Janus, I think no.Enter CASSIO, and certain Officers with torches


OTHELLO

The servants of the duke, and my lieutenant.The goodness of the night upon you, friends!What is the news?

CASSIO

                  The duke does greet you, general,And he requires your haste-post-haste appearance,Even on the instant.

OTHELLO

What is the matter, think you?

CASSIO

Something from Cyprus as I may divine:It is a business of some heat: the galleysHave sent a dozen sequent messengersThis very night at one another's heels,And many of the consuls, raised and met,Are at the duke's already: you have beenhotly call'd for;When, being not at your lodging to be found,The senate hath sent about three several guestsTo search you out.

OTHELLO

'Tis well I am found by you.I will but spend a word here in the house,And go with you.Exit


CASSIO

                  Ancient, what makes he here?

IAGO

'Faith, he to-night hath boarded a land carack:If it prove lawful prize, he's made for ever.

CASSIO

I do not understand.

IAGO

He's married.

CASSIO

To who?Re-enter OTHELLO


IAGO

Marry, to--Come, captain, will you go?

OTHELLO

Have with you.

CASSIO

Here comes another troop to seek for you.

IAGO

It is Brabantio. General, be advised;He comes to bad intent.Enter BRABANTIO, RODERIGO, and Officers with torches and weapons


OTHELLO

Holla! stand there!

RODERIGO

Signior, it is the Moor.

BRABANTIO

Down with him, thief!They draw on both sides


IAGO

You, Roderigo! come, sir, I am for you.

OTHELLO

Keep up your bright swords, for the dew will rust them.Good signior, you shall more command with yearsThan with your weapons.

BRABANTIO

O thou foul thief, where hast thou stow'd my daughter?Damn'd as thou art, thou hast enchanted her;For I'll refer me to all things of sense,If she in chains of magic were not bound,Whether a maid so tender, fair and happy,So opposite to marriage that she shunnedThe wealthy curled darlings of our nation,Would ever have, to incur a general mock,Run from her guardage to the sooty bosomOf such a thing as thou, to fear, not to delight.Judge me the world, if 'tis not gross in senseThat thou hast practised on her with foul charms,Abused her delicate youth with drugs or mineralsThat weaken motion: I'll have't disputed on;'Tis probable and palpable to thinking.I therefore apprehend and do attach theeFor an abuser of the world, a practiserOf arts inhibited and out of warrant.Lay hold upon him: if he do resist,Subdue him at his peril.

OTHELLO

Hold your hands,Both you of my inclining, and the rest:Were it my cue to fight, I should have known itWithout a prompter. Where will you that I goTo answer this your charge?

BRABANTIO

To prison, till fit timeOf law and course of direct sessionCall thee to answer.

OTHELLO

What if I do obey?How may the duke be therewith satisfied,Whose messengers are here about my side,Upon some present business of the stateTo bring me to him?

First Officer

'Tis true, most worthy signior;The duke's in council and your noble self,I am sure, is sent for.

BRABANTIO

How! the duke in council!In this time of the night! Bring him away:Mine's not an idle cause: the duke himself,Or any of my brothers of the state,Cannot but feel this wrong as 'twere their own;For if such actions may have passage free,Bond-slaves and pagans shall our statesmen be.Exeunt

SCENE III. A council-chamber.

The DUKE and Senators sitting at a table; Officers attending


DUKE OF VENICE

There is no composition in these newsThat gives them credit.

First Senator

Indeed, they are disproportion'd;My letters say a hundred and seven galleys.

DUKE OF VENICE

And mine, a hundred and forty.

Second Senator

And mine, two hundred:But though they jump not on a just account,--As in these cases, where the aim reports,'Tis oft with difference--yet do they all confirmA Turkish fleet, and bearing up to Cyprus.

DUKE OF VENICE

Nay, it is possible enough to judgment:I do not so secure me in the error,But the main article I do approveIn fearful sense.

Sailor

[Within]  What, ho! what, ho! what, ho!

First Officer

A messenger from the galleys.Enter a Sailor


DUKE OF VENICE

Now, what's the business?

Sailor

The Turkish preparation makes for Rhodes;So was I bid report here to the stateBy Signior Angelo.

DUKE OF VENICE

How say you by this change?

First Senator

This cannot be,By no assay of reason: 'tis a pageant,To keep us in false gaze. When we considerThe importancy of Cyprus to the Turk,And let ourselves again but understand,That as it more concerns the Turk than Rhodes,So may he with more facile question bear it,For that it stands not in such warlike brace,But altogether lacks the abilitiesThat Rhodes is dress'd in: if we make thought of this,We must not think the Turk is so unskilfulTo leave that latest which concerns him first,Neglecting an attempt of ease and gain,To wake and wage a danger profitless.

DUKE OF VENICE

Nay, in all confidence, he's not for Rhodes.

First Officer

Here is more news.Enter a Messenger


Messenger

The Ottomites, reverend and gracious,Steering with due course towards the isle of Rhodes,Have there injointed them with an after fleet.

First Senator

Ay, so I thought. How many, as you guess?

Messenger

Of thirty sail: and now they do restemTheir backward course, bearing with frank appearanceTheir purposes toward Cyprus. Signior Montano,Your trusty and most valiant servitor,With his free duty recommends you thus,And prays you to believe him.

DUKE OF VENICE

'Tis certain, then, for Cyprus.Marcus Luccicos, is not he in town?

First Senator

He's now in Florence.

DUKE OF VENICE

Write from us to him; post-post-haste dispatch.

First Senator

Here comes Brabantio and the valiant Moor.Enter BRABANTIO, OTHELLO, IAGO, RODERIGO, and Officers


DUKE OF VENICE

Valiant Othello, we must straight employ youAgainst the general enemy Ottoman.To BRABANTIO
I did not see you; welcome, gentle signior;We lack'd your counsel and your help tonight.

BRABANTIO

So did I yours. Good your grace, pardon me;Neither my place nor aught I heard of businessHath raised me from my bed, nor doth the general careTake hold on me, for my particular griefIs of so flood-gate and o'erbearing natureThat it engluts and swallows other sorrowsAnd it is still itself.

DUKE OF VENICE

Why, what's the matter?

BRABANTIO

My daughter! O, my daughter!

DUKE OF VENICE

Senator

Dead?

BRABANTIO

Ay, to me;She is abused, stol'n from me, and corruptedBy spells and medicines bought of mountebanks;For nature so preposterously to err,Being not deficient, blind, or lame of sense,Sans witchcraft could not.

DUKE OF VENICE

Whoe'er he be that in this foul proceedingHath thus beguiled your daughter of herselfAnd you of her, the bloody book of lawYou shall yourself read in the bitter letterAfter your own sense, yea, though our proper sonStood in your action.

BRABANTIO

Humbly I thank your grace.Here is the man, this Moor, whom now, it seems,Your special mandate for the state-affairsHath hither brought.

DUKE OF VENICE

Senator

We are very sorry for't.

DUKE OF VENICE

[To OTHELLO]  What, in your own part, can you say to this?

BRABANTIO

Nothing, but this is so.

OTHELLO

Most potent, grave, and reverend signiors,My very noble and approved good masters,That I have ta'en away this old man's daughter,It is most true; true, I have married her:The very head and front of my offendingHath this extent, no more. Rude am I in my speech,And little bless'd with the soft phrase of peace:For since these arms of mine had seven years' pith,Till now some nine moons wasted, they have usedTheir dearest action in the tented field,And little of this great world can I speak,More than pertains to feats of broil and battle,And therefore little shall I grace my causeIn speaking for myself. Yet, by your gracious patience,I will a round unvarnish'd tale deliverOf my whole course of love; what drugs, what charms,What conjuration and what mighty magic,For such proceeding I am charged withal,I won his daughter.

BRABANTIO

A maiden never bold;Of spirit so still and quiet, that her motionBlush'd at herself; and she, in spite of nature,Of years, of country, credit, every thing,To fall in love with what she fear'd to look on!It is a judgment maim'd and most imperfectThat will confess perfection so could errAgainst all rules of nature, and must be drivenTo find out practises of cunning hell,Why this should be. I therefore vouch againThat with some mixtures powerful o'er the blood,Or with some dram conjured to this effect,He wrought upon her.

DUKE OF VENICE

To vouch this, is no proof,Without more wider and more overt testThan these thin habits and poor likelihoodsOf modern seeming do prefer against him.

First Senator

But, Othello, speak:Did you by indirect and forced coursesSubdue and poison this young maid's affections?Or came it by request and such fair questionAs soul to soul affordeth?

OTHELLO

I do beseech you,Send for the lady to the Sagittary,And let her speak of me before her father:If you do find me foul in her report,The trust, the office I do hold of you,Not only take away, but let your sentenceEven fall upon my life.

DUKE OF VENICE

Fetch Desdemona hither.

OTHELLO

Ancient, conduct them: you best know the place.Exeunt IAGO and Attendants
And, till she come, as truly as to heavenI do confess the vices of my blood,So justly to your grave ears I'll presentHow I did thrive in this fair lady's love,And she in mine.

DUKE OF VENICE

Say it, Othello.

OTHELLO

Her father loved me; oft invited me;Still question'd me the story of my life,From year to year, the battles, sieges, fortunes,That I have passed.I ran it through, even from my boyish days,To the very moment that he bade me tell it;Wherein I spake of most disastrous chances,Of moving accidents by flood and fieldOf hair-breadth scapes i' the imminent deadly breach,Of being taken by the insolent foeAnd sold to slavery, of my redemption thenceAnd portance in my travels' history:Wherein of antres vast and deserts idle,Rough quarries, rocks and hills whose heads touch heavenIt was my hint to speak,--such was the process;And of the Cannibals that each other eat,The Anthropophagi and men whose headsDo grow beneath their shoulders. This to hearWould Desdemona seriously incline:But still the house-affairs would draw her thence:Which ever as she could with haste dispatch,She'ld come again, and with a greedy earDevour up my discourse: which I observing,Took once a pliant hour, and found good meansTo draw from her a prayer of earnest heartThat I would all my pilgrimage dilate,Whereof by parcels she had something heard,But not intentively: I did consent,And often did beguile her of her tears,When I did speak of some distressful strokeThat my youth suffer'd. My story being done,She gave me for my pains a world of sighs:She swore, in faith, twas strange, 'twas passing strange,'Twas pitiful, 'twas wondrous pitiful:She wish'd she had not heard it, yet she wish'dThat heaven had made her such a man: she thank'd me,And bade me, if I had a friend that loved her,I should but teach him how to tell my story.And that would woo her. Upon this hint I spake:She loved me for the dangers I had pass'd,And I loved her that she did pity them.This only is the witchcraft I have used:Here comes the lady; let her witness it.Enter DESDEMONA, IAGO, and Attendants


DUKE OF VENICE

I think this tale would win my daughter too.Good Brabantio,Take up this mangled matter at the best:Men do their broken weapons rather useThan their bare hands.

BRABANTIO

I pray you, hear her speak:If she confess that she was half the wooer,Destruction on my head, if my bad blameLight on the man! Come hither, gentle mistress:Do you perceive in all this noble companyWhere most you owe obedience?

DESDEMONA

My noble father,I do perceive here a divided duty:To you I am bound for life and education;My life and education both do learn meHow to respect you; you are the lord of duty;I am hitherto your daughter: but here's my husband,And so much duty as my mother show'dTo you, preferring you before her father,So much I challenge that I may professDue to the Moor my lord.

BRABANTIO

God be wi' you! I have done.Please it your grace, on to the state-affairs:I had rather to adopt a child than get it.Come hither, Moor:I here do give thee that with all my heartWhich, but thou hast already, with all my heartI would keep from thee. For your sake, jewel,I am glad at soul I have no other child:For thy escape would teach me tyranny,To hang clogs on them. I have done, my lord.

DUKE OF VENICE

Let me speak like yourself, and lay a sentence,Which, as a grise or step, may help these loversInto your favour.When remedies are past, the griefs are endedBy seeing the worst, which late on hopes depended.To mourn a mischief that is past and goneIs the next way to draw new mischief on.What cannot be preserved when fortune takesPatience her injury a mockery makes.The robb'd that smiles steals something from the thief;He robs himself that spends a bootless grief.

BRABANTIO

So let the Turk of Cyprus us beguile;We lose it not, so long as we can smile.He bears the sentence well that nothing bearsBut the free comfort which from thence he hears,But he bears both the sentence and the sorrowThat, to pay grief, must of poor patience borrow.These sentences, to sugar, or to gall,Being strong on both sides, are equivocal:But words are words; I never yet did hearThat the bruised heart was pierced through the ear.I humbly beseech you, proceed to the affairs of state.

DUKE OF VENICE

The Turk with a most mighty preparation makes forCyprus. Othello, the fortitude of the place is bestknown to you; and though we have there a substituteof most allowed sufficiency, yet opinion, asovereign mistress of effects, throws a more safervoice on you: you must therefore be content toslubber the gloss of your new fortunes with thismore stubborn and boisterous expedition.

OTHELLO

The tyrant custom, most grave senators,Hath made the flinty and steel couch of warMy thrice-driven bed of down: I do agniseA natural and prompt alacrityI find in hardness, and do undertakeThese present wars against the Ottomites.Most humbly therefore bending to your state,I crave fit disposition for my wife.Due reference of place and exhibition,With such accommodation and besortAs levels with her breeding.

DUKE OF VENICE

If you please,Be't at her father's.

BRABANTIO

I'll not have it so.

OTHELLO

Nor I.

DESDEMONA

     Nor I; I would not there reside,To put my father in impatient thoughtsBy being in his eye. Most gracious duke,To my unfolding lend your prosperous ear;And let me find a charter in your voice,To assist my simpleness.

DUKE OF VENICE

What would You, Desdemona?

DESDEMONA

That I did love the Moor to live with him,My downright violence and storm of fortunesMay trumpet to the world: my heart's subduedEven to the very quality of my lord:I saw Othello's visage in his mind,And to his honour and his valiant partsDid I my soul and fortunes consecrate.So that, dear lords, if I be left behind,A moth of peace, and he go to the war,The rites for which I love him are bereft me,And I a heavy interim shall supportBy his dear absence. Let me go with him.

OTHELLO

Let her have your voices.Vouch with me, heaven, I therefore beg it not,To please the palate of my appetite,Nor to comply with heat--the young affectsIn me defunct--and proper satisfaction.But to be free and bounteous to her mind:And heaven defend your good souls, that you thinkI will your serious and great business scantFor she is with me: no, when light-wing'd toysOf feather'd Cupid seal with wanton dullnessMy speculative and officed instruments,That my disports corrupt and taint my business,Let housewives make a skillet of my helm,And all indign and base adversitiesMake head against my estimation!

DUKE OF VENICE

Be it as you shall privately determine,Either for her stay or going: the affair cries haste,And speed must answer it.

First Senator

You must away to-night.

OTHELLO

With all my heart.

DUKE OF VENICE

At nine i' the morning here we'll meet again.Othello, leave some officer behind,And he shall our commission bring to you;With such things else of quality and respectAs doth import you.

OTHELLO

So please your grace, my ancient;A man he is of honest and trust:To his conveyance I assign my wife,With what else needful your good grace shall thinkTo be sent after me.

DUKE OF VENICE

Let it be so.Good night to every one.To BRABANTIO
And, noble signior,If virtue no delighted beauty lack,Your son-in-law is far more fair than black.

First Senator

Adieu, brave Moor, use Desdemona well.

BRABANTIO

Look to her, Moor, if thou hast eyes to see:She has deceived her father, and may thee.Exeunt DUKE OF VENICE, Senators, Officers,  & c


OTHELLO

My life upon her faith! Honest Iago,My Desdemona must I leave to thee:I prithee, let thy wife attend on her:And bring them after in the best advantage.Come, Desdemona: I have but an hourOf love, of worldly matters and direction,To spend with thee: we must obey the time.Exeunt OTHELLO and DESDEMONA


RODERIGO

Iago,--

IAGO

What say'st thou, noble heart?

RODERIGO

What will I do, thinkest thou?

IAGO

Why, go to bed, and sleep.

RODERIGO

I will incontinently drown myself.

IAGO

If thou dost, I shall never love thee after. Why,thou silly gentleman!

RODERIGO

It is silliness to live when to live is torment; andthen have we a prescription to die when death is our physician.

IAGO

O villainous! I have looked upon the world for fourtimes seven years; and since I could distinguishbetwixt a benefit and an injury, I never found manthat knew how to love himself. Ere I would say, Iwould drown myself for the love of a guinea-hen, Iwould change my humanity with a baboon.

RODERIGO

What should I do? I confess it is my shame to be sofond; but it is not in my virtue to amend it.

IAGO

Virtue! a fig! 'tis in ourselves that we are thusor thus. Our bodies are our gardens, to the whichour wills are gardeners: so that if we will plantnettles, or sow lettuce, set hyssop and weed upthyme, supply it with one gender of herbs, ordistract it with many, either to have it sterilewith idleness, or manured with industry, why, thepower and corrigible authority of this lies in ourwills. If the balance of our lives had not onescale of reason to poise another of sensuality, theblood and baseness of our natures would conduct usto most preposterous conclusions: but we havereason to cool our raging motions, our carnalstings, our unbitted lusts, whereof I take this thatyou call love to be a sect or scion.

RODERIGO

It cannot be.

IAGO

It is merely a lust of the blood and a permission ofthe will. Come, be a man. Drown thyself! drowncats and blind puppies. I have professed me thyfriend and I confess me knit to thy deserving withcables of perdurable toughness; I could neverbetter stead thee than now. Put money in thypurse; follow thou the wars; defeat thy favour withan usurped beard; I say, put money in thy purse. Itcannot be that Desdemona should long continue herlove to the Moor,-- put money in thy purse,--nor hehis to her: it was a violent commencement, and thoushalt see an answerable sequestration:--put butmoney in thy purse. These Moors are changeable intheir wills: fill thy purse with money:--the foodthat to him now is as luscious as locusts, shall beto him shortly as bitter as coloquintida. She mustchange for youth: when she is sated with his body,she will find the error of her choice: she musthave change, she must: therefore put money in thypurse. If thou wilt needs damn thyself, do it amore delicate way than drowning. Make all the moneythou canst: if sanctimony and a frail vow betwixtan erring barbarian and a supersubtle Venetian nottoo hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell, thoushalt enjoy her; therefore make money. A pox ofdrowning thyself! it is clean out of the way: seekthou rather to be hanged in compassing thy joy thanto be drowned and go without her.

RODERIGO

Wilt thou be fast to my hopes, if I depend onthe issue?

IAGO

Thou art sure of me:--go, make money:--I have toldthee often, and I re-tell thee again and again, Ihate the Moor: my cause is hearted; thine hath noless reason. Let us be conjunctive in our revengeagainst him: if thou canst cuckold him, thou dostthyself a pleasure, me a sport. There are manyevents in the womb of time which will be delivered.Traverse! go, provide thy money. We will have moreof this to-morrow. Adieu.

RODERIGO

Where shall we meet i' the morning?

IAGO

At my lodging.

RODERIGO

I'll be with thee betimes.

IAGO

Go to; farewell. Do you hear, Roderigo?

RODERIGO

What say you?

IAGO

No more of drowning, do you hear?

RODERIGO

I am changed: I'll go sell all my land.Exit


IAGO

Thus do I ever make my fool my purse:For I mine own gain'd knowledge should profane,If I would time expend with such a snipe.But for my sport and profit. I hate the Moor:And it is thought abroad, that 'twixt my sheetsHe has done my office: I know not if't be true;But I, for mere suspicion in that kind,Will do as if for surety. He holds me well;The better shall my purpose work on him.Cassio's a proper man: let me see now:To get his place and to plume up my willIn double knavery--How, how? Let's see:--After some time, to abuse Othello's earThat he is too familiar with his wife.He hath a person and a smooth disposeTo be suspected, framed to make women false.The Moor is of a free and open nature,That thinks men honest that but seem to be so,And will as tenderly be led by the noseAs asses are.I have't. It is engender'd. Hell and nightMust bring this monstrous birth to the world's light.Exit

ACT II
SCENE I. A Sea-port in Cyprus. An open place near the quay.

Enter MONTANO and two Gentlemen


MONTANO

What from the cape can you discern at sea?

First Gentleman

Nothing at all: it is a highwrought flood;I cannot, 'twixt the heaven and the main,Descry a sail.

MONTANO

Methinks the wind hath spoke aloud at land;A fuller blast ne'er shook our battlements:If it hath ruffian'd so upon the sea,What ribs of oak, when mountains melt on them,Can hold the mortise? What shall we hear of this?

Second Gentleman

A segregation of the Turkish fleet:For do but stand upon the foaming shore,The chidden billow seems to pelt the clouds;The wind-shaked surge, with high and monstrous mane,seems to cast water on the burning bear,And quench the guards of the ever-fixed pole:I never did like molestation viewOn the enchafed flood.

MONTANO

If that the Turkish fleetBe not enshelter'd and embay'd, they are drown'd:It is impossible they bear it out.Enter a third Gentleman


Third Gentleman

News, lads! our wars are done.The desperate tempest hath so bang'd the Turks,That their designment halts: a noble ship of VeniceHath seen a grievous wreck and sufferanceOn most part of their fleet.

MONTANO

How! is this true?

Third Gentleman

The ship is here put in,A Veronesa; Michael Cassio,Lieutenant to the warlike Moor Othello,Is come on shore: the Moor himself at sea,And is in full commission here for Cyprus.

MONTANO

I am glad on't; 'tis a worthy governor.

Third Gentleman

But this same Cassio, though he speak of comfortTouching the Turkish loss, yet he looks sadly,And prays the Moor be safe; for they were partedWith foul and violent tempest.

MONTANO

Pray heavens he be;For I have served him, and the man commandsLike a full soldier. Let's to the seaside, ho!As well to see the vessel that's come inAs to throw out our eyes for brave Othello,Even till we make the main and the aerial blueAn indistinct regard.

Third Gentleman

Come, let's do so:For every minute is expectancyOf more arrivance.Enter CASSIO


CASSIO

Thanks, you the valiant of this warlike isle,That so approve the Moor! O, let the heavensGive him defence against the elements,For I have lost us him on a dangerous sea.

MONTANO

Is he well shipp'd?

CASSIO

His bark is stoutly timber'd, his pilotOf very expert and approved allowance;Therefore my hopes, not surfeited to death,Stand in bold cure.A cry within 'A sail, a sail, a sail!'
Enter a fourth Gentleman


CASSIO

What noise?

Fourth Gentleman

The town is empty; on the brow o' the seaStand ranks of people, and they cry 'A sail!'

CASSIO

My hopes do shape him for the governor.Guns heard


Second Gentlemen

They do discharge their shot of courtesy:Our friends at least.

CASSIO

I pray you, sir, go forth,And give us truth who 'tis that is arrived.

Second Gentleman

I shall.Exit


MONTANO

But, good lieutenant, is your general wived?

CASSIO

Most fortunately: he hath achieved a maidThat paragons description and wild fame;One that excels the quirks of blazoning pens,And in the essential vesture of creationDoes tire the ingener.Re-enter second Gentleman
How now! who has put in?

Second Gentleman

'Tis one Iago, ancient to the general.

CASSIO

Has had most favourable and happy speed:Tempests themselves, high seas, and howling winds,The gutter'd rocks and congregated sands--Traitors ensteep'd to clog the guiltless keel,--As having sense of beauty, do omitTheir mortal natures, letting go safely byThe divine Desdemona.

MONTANO

What is she?

CASSIO

She that I spake of, our great captain's captain,Left in the conduct of the bold Iago,Whose footing here anticipates our thoughtsA se'nnight's speed. Great Jove, Othello guard,And swell his sail with thine own powerful breath,That he may bless this bay with his tall ship,Make love's quick pants in Desdemona's arms,Give renew'd fire to our extincted spiritsAnd bring all Cyprus comfort!Enter DESDEMONA, EMILIA, IAGO, RODERIGO, and Attendants
O, behold,The riches of the ship is come on shore!Ye men of Cyprus, let her have your knees.Hail to thee, lady! and the grace of heaven,Before, behind thee, and on every hand,Enwheel thee round!

DESDEMONA

I thank you, valiant Cassio.What tidings can you tell me of my lord?

CASSIO

He is not yet arrived: nor know I aughtBut that he's well and will be shortly here.

DESDEMONA

O, but I fear--How lost you company?

CASSIO

The great contention of the sea and skiesParted our fellowship--But, hark! a sail.Within 'A sail, a sail!' Guns heard


Second Gentleman

They give their greeting to the citadel;This likewise is a friend.

CASSIO

See for the news.Exit Gentleman
Good ancient, you are welcome.To EMILIA
Welcome, mistress.Let it not gall your patience, good Iago,That I extend my manners; 'tis my breedingThat gives me this bold show of courtesy.Kissing her


IAGO

Sir, would she give you so much of her lipsAs of her tongue she oft bestows on me,You'll have enough.

DESDEMONA

Alas, she has no speech.

IAGO

In faith, too much;I find it still, when I have list to sleep:Marry, before your ladyship, I grant,She puts her tongue a little in her heart,And chides with thinking.

EMILIA

You have little cause to say so.

IAGO

Come on, come on; you are pictures out of doors,Bells in your parlors, wild-cats in your kitchens,Saints m your injuries, devils being offended,Players in your housewifery, and housewives' in your beds.

DESDEMONA

O, fie upon thee, slanderer!

IAGO

Nay, it is true, or else I am a Turk:You rise to play and go to bed to work.

EMILIA

You shall not write my praise.

IAGO

No, let me not.

DESDEMONA

What wouldst thou write of me, if thou shouldstpraise me?

IAGO

O gentle lady, do not put me to't;For I am nothing, if not critical.

DESDEMONA

Come on assay. There's one gone to the harbour?

IAGO

Ay, madam.

DESDEMONA

I am not merry; but I do beguileThe thing I am, by seeming otherwise.Come, how wouldst thou praise me?

IAGO

I am about it; but indeed my inventionComes from my pate as birdlime does from frize;It plucks out brains and all: but my Muse labours,And thus she is deliver'd.If she be fair and wise, fairness and wit,The one's for use, the other useth it.

DESDEMONA

Well praised! How if she be black and witty?

IAGO

If she be black, and thereto have a wit,She'll find a white that shall her blackness fit.

DESDEMONA

Worse and worse.

EMILIA

How if fair and foolish?

IAGO

She never yet was foolish that was fair;For even her folly help'd her to an heir.

DESDEMONA

These are old fond paradoxes to make fools laugh i'the alehouse. What miserable praise hast thou forher that's foul and foolish?

IAGO

There's none so foul and foolish thereunto,But does foul pranks which fair and wise ones do.

DESDEMONA

O heavy ignorance! thou praisest the worst best.But what praise couldst thou bestow on a deservingwoman indeed, one that, in the authority of hermerit, did justly put on the vouch of very malice itself?

IAGO

She that was ever fair and never proud,Had tongue at will and yet was never loud,Never lack'd gold and yet went never gay,Fled from her wish and yet said 'Now I may,'She that being anger'd, her revenge being nigh,Bade her wrong stay and her displeasure fly,She that in wisdom never was so frailTo change the cod's head for the salmon's tail;She that could think and ne'er disclose her mind,See suitors following and not look behind,She was a wight, if ever such wight were,--

DESDEMONA

To do what?

IAGO

To suckle fools and chronicle small beer.

DESDEMONA

O most lame and impotent conclusion! Do not learnof him, Emilia, though he be thy husband. How sayyou, Cassio? is he not a most profane and liberalcounsellor?

CASSIO

He speaks home, madam: You may relish him more inthe soldier than in the scholar.

IAGO

[Aside]  He takes her by the palm: ay, well said,whisper: with as little a web as this will Iensnare as great a fly as Cassio. Ay, smile uponher, do; I will gyve thee in thine own courtship.You say true; 'tis so, indeed: if such tricks asthese strip you out of your lieutenantry, it hadbeen better you had not kissed your three fingers sooft, which now again you are most apt to play thesir in. Very good; well kissed! an excellentcourtesy! 'tis so, indeed. Yet again your fingersto your lips? would they were clyster-pipes for your sake!Trumpet within
The Moor! I know his trumpet.

CASSIO

'Tis truly so.

DESDEMONA

Let's meet him and receive him.

CASSIO

Lo, where he comes!Enter OTHELLO and Attendants


OTHELLO

O my fair warrior!

DESDEMONA

                  My dear Othello!

OTHELLO

It gives me wonder great as my contentTo see you here before me. O my soul's joy!If after every tempest come such calms,May the winds blow till they have waken'd death!And let the labouring bark climb hills of seasOlympus-high and duck again as lowAs hell's from heaven! If it were now to die,'Twere now to be most happy; for, I fear,My soul hath her content so absoluteThat not another comfort like to thisSucceeds in unknown fate.

DESDEMONA

The heavens forbidBut that our loves and comforts should increase,Even as our days do grow!

OTHELLO

Amen to that, sweet powers!I cannot speak enough of this content;It stops me here; it is too much of joy:And this, and this, the greatest discords beKissing her
That e'er our hearts shall make!

IAGO

[Aside]  O, you are well tuned now!But I'll set down the pegs that make this music,As honest as I am.

OTHELLO

                  Come, let us to the castle.News, friends; our wars are done, the Turksare drown'd.How does my old acquaintance of this isle?Honey, you shall be well desired in Cyprus;I have found great love amongst them. O my sweet,I prattle out of fashion, and I doteIn mine own comforts. I prithee, good Iago,Go to the bay and disembark my coffers:Bring thou the master to the citadel;He is a good one, and his worthinessDoes challenge much respect. Come, Desdemona,Once more, well met at Cyprus.Exeunt OTHELLO, DESDEMONA, and Attendants


IAGO

Do thou meet me presently at the harbour. Comehither. If thou be'st valiant,-- as, they say, basemen being in love have then a nobility in theirnatures more than is native to them--list me. Thelieutenant tonight watches on the court ofguard:--first, I must tell thee this--Desdemona isdirectly in love with him.

RODERIGO

With him! why, 'tis not possible.

IAGO

Lay thy finger thus, and let thy soul be instructed.Mark me with what violence she first loved the Moor,but for bragging and telling her fantastical lies:and will she love him still for prating? let notthy discreet heart think it. Her eye must be fed;and what delight shall she have to look on thedevil? When the blood is made dull with the act ofsport, there should be, again to inflame it and togive satiety a fresh appetite, loveliness in favour,sympathy in years, manners and beauties; all whichthe Moor is defective in: now, for want of theserequired conveniences, her delicate tenderness willfind itself abused, begin to heave the gorge,disrelish and abhor the Moor; very nature willinstruct her in it and compel her to some secondchoice. Now, sir, this granted,--as it is a mostpregnant and unforced position--who stands soeminent in the degree of this fortune as Cassiodoes? a knave very voluble; no furtherconscionable than in putting on the mere form ofcivil and humane seeming, for the better compassingof his salt and most hidden loose affection? why,none; why, none: a slipper and subtle knave, afinder of occasions, that has an eye can stamp andcounterfeit advantages, though true advantage neverpresent itself; a devilish knave. Besides, theknave is handsome, young, and hath all thoserequisites in him that folly and green minds lookafter: a pestilent complete knave; and the womanhath found him already.

RODERIGO

I cannot believe that in her; she's full ofmost blessed condition.

IAGO

Blessed fig's-end! the wine she drinks is made ofgrapes: if she had been blessed, she would neverhave loved the Moor. Blessed pudding! Didst thounot see her paddle with the palm of his hand? didstnot mark that?

RODERIGO

Yes, that I did; but that was but courtesy.

IAGO

Lechery, by this hand; an index and obscure prologueto the history of lust and foul thoughts. They metso near with their lips that their breaths embracedtogether. Villanous thoughts, Roderigo! when thesemutualities so marshal the way, hard at hand comesthe master and main exercise, the incorporateconclusion, Pish! But, sir, be you ruled by me: Ihave brought you from Venice. Watch you to-night;for the command, I'll lay't upon you. Cassio knowsyou not. I'll not be far from you: do you findsome occasion to anger Cassio, either by speakingtoo loud, or tainting his discipline; or from whatother course you please, which the time shall morefavourably minister.

RODERIGO

Well.

IAGO

Sir, he is rash and very sudden in choler, and haplymay strike at you: provoke him, that he may; foreven out of that will I cause these of Cyprus tomutiny; whose qualification shall come into no truetaste again but by the displanting of Cassio. Soshall you have a shorter journey to your desires bythe means I shall then have to prefer them; and theimpediment most profitably removed, without thewhich there were no expectation of our prosperity.

RODERIGO

I will do this, if I can bring it to anyopportunity.

IAGO

I warrant thee. Meet me by and by at the citadel:I must fetch his necessaries ashore. Farewell.

RODERIGO

Adieu.Exit


IAGO

That Cassio loves her, I do well believe it;That she loves him, 'tis apt and of great credit:The Moor, howbeit that I endure him not,Is of a constant, loving, noble nature,And I dare think he'll prove to DesdemonaA most dear husband. Now, I do love her too;Not out of absolute lust, though peradventureI stand accountant for as great a sin,But partly led to diet my revenge,For that I do suspect the lusty MoorHath leap'd into my seat; the thought whereofDoth, like a poisonous mineral, gnaw my inwards;And nothing can or shall content my soulTill I am even'd with him, wife for wife,Or failing so, yet that I put the MoorAt least into a jealousy so strongThat judgment cannot cure. Which thing to do,If this poor trash of Venice, whom I trashFor his quick hunting, stand the putting on,I'll have our Michael Cassio on the hip,Abuse him to the Moor in the rank garb--For I fear Cassio with my night-cap too--Make the Moor thank me, love me and reward me.For making him egregiously an assAnd practising upon his peace and quietEven to madness. 'Tis here, but yet confused:Knavery's plain face is never seen tin used.Exit

SCENE II. A street.

Enter a Herald with a proclamation; People following


Herald

It is Othello's pleasure, our noble and valiantgeneral, that, upon certain tidings now arrived,importing the mere perdition of the Turkish fleet,every man put himself into triumph; some to dance,some to make bonfires, each man to what sport andrevels his addiction leads him: for, besides thesebeneficial news, it is the celebration of hisnuptial. So much was his pleasure should beproclaimed. All offices are open, and there is fullliberty of feasting from this present hour of fivetill the bell have told eleven. Heaven bless theisle of Cyprus and our noble general Othello!Exeunt

SCENE III. A hall in the castle.

Enter OTHELLO, DESDEMONA, CASSIO, and Attendants


OTHELLO

Good Michael, look you to the guard to-night:Let's teach ourselves that honourable stop,Not to outsport discretion.

CASSIO

Iago hath direction what to do;But, notwithstanding, with my personal eyeWill I look to't.

OTHELLO

                  Iago is most honest.Michael, good night: to-morrow with your earliestLet me have speech with you.To DESDEMONA
Come, my dear love,The purchase made, the fruits are to ensue;That profit's yet to come 'tween me and you.Good night.Exeunt OTHELLO, DESDEMONA, and Attendants
Enter IAGO


CASSIO

Welcome, Iago; we must to the watch.

IAGO

Not this hour, lieutenant; 'tis not yet ten o' theclock. Our general cast us thus early for the loveof his Desdemona; who let us not therefore blame:he hath not yet made wanton the night with her; andshe is sport for Jove.

CASSIO

She's a most exquisite lady.

IAGO

And, I'll warrant her, fun of game.

CASSIO

Indeed, she's a most fresh and delicate creature.

IAGO

What an eye she has! methinks it sounds a parley ofprovocation.

CASSIO

An inviting eye; and yet methinks right modest.

IAGO

And when she speaks, is it not an alarum to love?

CASSIO

She is indeed perfection.

IAGO

Well, happiness to their sheets! Come, lieutenant, Ihave a stoup of wine; and here without are a braceof Cyprus gallants that would fain have a measure tothe health of black Othello.

CASSIO

Not to-night, good Iago: I have very poor andunhappy brains for drinking: I could well wishcourtesy would invent some other custom ofentertainment.

IAGO

O, they are our friends; but one cup: I'll drink foryou.

CASSIO

I have drunk but one cup to-night, and that wascraftily qualified too, and, behold, what innovationit makes here: I am unfortunate in the infirmity,and dare not task my weakness with any more.

IAGO

What, man! 'tis a night of revels: the gallantsdesire it.

CASSIO

Where are they?

IAGO

Here at the door; I pray you, call them in.

CASSIO

I'll do't; but it dislikes me.Exit


IAGO

If I can fasten but one cup upon him,With that which he hath drunk to-night already,He'll be as full of quarrel and offenceAs my young mistress' dog. Now, my sick fool Roderigo,Whom love hath turn'd almost the wrong side out,To Desdemona hath to-night carousedPotations pottle-deep; and he's to watch:Three lads of Cyprus, noble swelling spirits,That hold their honours in a wary distance,The very elements of this warlike isle,Have I to-night fluster'd with flowing cups,And they watch too. Now, 'mongst this flock of drunkards,Am I to put our Cassio in some actionThat may offend the isle.--But here they come:If consequence do but approve my dream,My boat sails freely, both with wind and stream.Re-enter CASSIO; with him MONTANO and Gentlemen; servants following with wine


CASSIO

'Fore God, they have given me a rouse already.

MONTANO

Good faith, a little one; not past a pint, as I ama soldier.

IAGO

Some wine, ho!Sings
And let me the canakin clink, clink;And let me the canakin clinkA soldier's a man;A life's but a span;Why, then, let a soldier drink.Some wine, boys!

CASSIO

'Fore God, an excellent song.

IAGO

I learned it in England, where, indeed, they aremost potent in potting: your Dane, your German, andyour swag-bellied Hollander--Drink, ho!--are nothingto your English.

CASSIO

Is your Englishman so expert in his drinking?

IAGO

Why, he drinks you, with facility, your Dane deaddrunk; he sweats not to overthrow your Almain; hegives your Hollander a vomit, ere the next pottlecan be filled.

CASSIO

To the health of our general!

MONTANO

I am for it, lieutenant; and I'll do you justice.

IAGO

O sweet England!King Stephen was a worthy peer,His breeches cost him but a crown;He held them sixpence all too dear,With that he call'd the tailor lown.He was a wight of high renown,And thou art but of low degree:'Tis pride that pulls the country down;Then take thine auld cloak about thee.Some wine, ho!

CASSIO

Why, this is a more exquisite song than the other.

IAGO

Will you hear't again?

CASSIO

No; for I hold him to be unworthy of his place thatdoes those things. Well, God's above all; and therebe souls must be saved, and there be souls must not be saved.

IAGO

It's true, good lieutenant.

CASSIO

For mine own part,--no offence to the general, norany man of quality,--I hope to be saved.

IAGO

And so do I too, lieutenant.

CASSIO

Ay, but, by your leave, not before me; thelieutenant is to be saved before the ancient. Let'shave no more of this; let's to our affairs.--Forgiveus our sins!--Gentlemen, let's look to our business.Do not think, gentlemen. I am drunk: this is myancient; this is my right hand, and this is my left:I am not drunk now; I can stand well enough, andspeak well enough.

All

Excellent well.

CASSIO

Why, very well then; you must not think then that I am drunk.Exit


MONTANO

To the platform, masters; come, let's set the watch.

IAGO

You see this fellow that is gone before;He is a soldier fit to stand by CaesarAnd give direction: and do but see his vice;'Tis to his virtue a just equinox,The one as long as the other: 'tis pity of him.I fear the trust Othello puts him in.On some odd time of his infirmity,Will shake this island.

MONTANO

But is he often thus?

IAGO

'Tis evermore the prologue to his sleep:He'll watch the horologe a double set,If drink rock not his cradle.

MONTANO

It were wellThe general were put in mind of it.Perhaps he sees it not; or his good naturePrizes the virtue that appears in Cassio,And looks not on his evils: is not this true?Enter RODERIGO


IAGO

[Aside to him]  How now, Roderigo!I pray you, after the lieutenant; go.Exit RODERIGO


MONTANO

And 'tis great pity that the noble MoorShould hazard such a place as his own secondWith one of an ingraft infirmity:It were an honest action to saySo to the Moor.

IAGO

                  Not I, for this fair island:I do love Cassio well; and would do muchTo cure him of this evil--But, hark! what noise?Cry within: 'Help! help!'
Re-enter CASSIO, driving in RODERIGO


CASSIO

You rogue! you rascal!

MONTANO

What's the matter, lieutenant?

CASSIO

A knave teach me my duty!I'll beat the knave into a twiggen bottle.

RODERIGO

Beat me!

CASSIO

       Dost thou prate, rogue?Striking RODERIGO


MONTANO

Nay, good lieutenant;Staying him
I pray you, sir, hold your hand.

CASSIO

Let me go, sir,Or I'll knock you o'er the mazzard.

MONTANO

Come, come,you're drunk.

CASSIO

Drunk!They fight


IAGO

[Aside to RODERIGO]  Away, I say; go out, and cry a mutiny.Exit RODERIGO
Nay, good lieutenant,--alas, gentlemen;--Help, ho!--Lieutenant,--sir,--Montano,--sir;Help, masters!--Here's a goodly watch indeed!Bell rings
Who's that which rings the bell?--Diablo, ho!The town will rise: God's will, lieutenant, hold!You will be shamed for ever.Re-enter OTHELLO and Attendants


OTHELLO

What is the matter here?

MONTANO

'Zounds, I bleed still; I am hurt to the death.Faints


OTHELLO

Hold, for your lives!

IAGO

Hold, ho! Lieutenant,--sir--Montano,--gentlemen,--Have you forgot all sense of place and duty?Hold! the general speaks to you; hold, hold, for shame!

OTHELLO

Why, how now, ho! from whence ariseth this?Are we turn'd Turks, and to ourselves do thatWhich heaven hath forbid the Ottomites?For Christian shame, put by this barbarous brawl:He that stirs next to carve for his own rageHolds his soul light; he dies upon his motion.Silence that dreadful bell: it frights the isleFrom her propriety. What is the matter, masters?Honest Iago, that look'st dead with grieving,Speak, who began this? on thy love, I charge thee.

IAGO

I do not know: friends all but now, even now,In quarter, and in terms like bride and groomDevesting them for bed; and then, but now--As if some planet had unwitted men--Swords out, and tilting one at other's breast,In opposition bloody. I cannot speakAny beginning to this peevish odds;And would in action glorious I had lostThose legs that brought me to a part of it!

OTHELLO

How comes it, Michael, you are thus forgot?

CASSIO

I pray you, pardon me; I cannot speak.

OTHELLO

Worthy Montano, you were wont be civil;The gravity and stillness of your youthThe world hath noted, and your name is greatIn mouths of wisest censure: what's the matter,That you unlace your reputation thusAnd spend your rich opinion for the nameOf a night-brawler? give me answer to it.

MONTANO

Worthy Othello, I am hurt to danger:Your officer, Iago, can inform you,--While I spare speech, which something nowoffends me,--Of all that I do know: nor know I aughtBy me that's said or done amiss this night;Unless self-charity be sometimes a vice,And to defend ourselves it be a sinWhen violence assails us.

OTHELLO

Now, by heaven,My blood begins my safer guides to rule;And passion, having my best judgment collied,Assays to lead the way: if I once stir,Or do but lift this arm, the best of youShall sink in my rebuke. Give me to knowHow this foul rout began, who set it on;And he that is approved in this offence,Though he had twinn'd with me, both at a birth,Shall lose me. What! in a town of war,Yet wild, the people's hearts brimful of fear,To manage private and domestic quarrel,In night, and on the court and guard of safety!'Tis monstrous. Iago, who began't?

MONTANO

If partially affined, or leagued in office,Thou dost deliver more or less than truth,Thou art no soldier.

IAGO

Touch me not so near:I had rather have this tongue cut from my mouthThan it should do offence to Michael Cassio;Yet, I persuade myself, to speak the truthShall nothing wrong him. Thus it is, general.Montano and myself being in speech,There comes a fellow crying out for help:And Cassio following him with determined sword,To execute upon him. Sir, this gentlemanSteps in to Cassio, and entreats his pause:Myself the crying fellow did pursue,Lest by his clamour--as it so fell out--The town might fall in fright: he, swift of foot,Outran my purpose; and I return'd the ratherFor that I heard the clink and fall of swords,And Cassio high in oath; which till to-nightI ne'er might say before. When I came back--For this was brief--I found them close together,At blow and thrust; even as again they wereWhen you yourself did part them.More of this matter cannot I report:But men are men; the best sometimes forget:Though Cassio did some little wrong to him,As men in rage strike those that wish them best,Yet surely Cassio, I believe, receivedFrom him that fled some strange indignity,Which patience could not pass.

OTHELLO

I know, Iago,Thy honesty and love doth mince this matter,Making it light to Cassio. Cassio, I love theeBut never more be officer of mine.Re-enter DESDEMONA, attended
Look, if my gentle love be not raised up!I'll make thee an example.

DESDEMONA

What's the matter?

OTHELLO

All's well now, sweeting; come away to bed.Sir, for your hurts, myself will be your surgeon:Lead him off.To MONTANO, who is led off
Iago, look with care about the town,And silence those whom this vile brawl distracted.Come, Desdemona: 'tis the soldiers' lifeTo have their balmy slumbers waked with strife.Exeunt all but IAGO and CASSIO


IAGO

What, are you hurt, lieutenant?

CASSIO

Ay, past all surgery.

IAGO

Marry, heaven forbid!

CASSIO

Reputation, reputation, reputation! O, I have lostmy reputation! I have lost the immortal part ofmyself, and what remains is bestial. My reputation,Iago, my reputation!

IAGO

As I am an honest man, I thought you had receivedsome bodily wound; there is more sense in that thanin reputation. Reputation is an idle and most falseimposition: oft got without merit, and lost withoutdeserving: you have lost no reputation at all,unless you repute yourself such a loser. What, man!there are ways to recover the general again: youare but now cast in his mood, a punishment more inpolicy than in malice, even so as one would beat hisoffenceless dog to affright an imperious lion: sueto him again, and he's yours.

CASSIO

I will rather sue to be despised than to deceive sogood a commander with so slight, so drunken, and soindiscreet an officer. Drunk? and speak parrot?and squabble? swagger? swear? and discoursefustian with one's own shadow? O thou invisiblespirit of wine, if thou hast no name to be known by,let us call thee devil!

IAGO

What was he that you followed with your sword? Whathad he done to you?

CASSIO

I know not.

IAGO

Is't possible?

CASSIO

I remember a mass of things, but nothing distinctly;a quarrel, but nothing wherefore. O God, that menshould put an enemy in their mouths to steal awaytheir brains! that we should, with joy, pleasancerevel and applause, transform ourselves into beasts!

IAGO

Why, but you are now well enough: how came you thusrecovered?

CASSIO

It hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give placeto the devil wrath; one unperfectness shows meanother, to make me frankly despise myself.

IAGO

Come, you are too severe a moraler: as the time,the place, and the condition of this countrystands, I could heartily wish this had not befallen;but, since it is as it is, mend it for your own good.

CASSIO

I will ask him for my place again; he shall tell meI am a drunkard! Had I as many mouths as Hydra,such an answer would stop them all. To be now asensible man, by and by a fool, and presently abeast! O strange! Every inordinate cup isunblessed and the ingredient is a devil.

IAGO

Come, come, good wine is a good familiar creature,if it be well used: exclaim no more against it.And, good lieutenant, I think you think I love you.

CASSIO

I have well approved it, sir. I drunk!

IAGO

You or any man living may be drunk! at a time, man.I'll tell you what you shall do. Our general's wifeis now the general: may say so in this respect, forthat he hath devoted and given up himself to thecontemplation, mark, and denotement of her parts andgraces: confess yourself freely to her; importuneher help to put you in your place again: she is ofso free, so kind, so apt, so blessed a disposition,she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do morethan she is requested: this broken joint betweenyou and her husband entreat her to splinter; and, myfortunes against any lay worth naming, thiscrack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before.

CASSIO

You advise me well.

IAGO

I protest, in the sincerity of love and honest kindness.

CASSIO

I think it freely; and betimes in the morning I willbeseech the virtuous Desdemona to undertake for me:I am desperate of my fortunes if they cheque me here.

IAGO

You are in the right. Good night, lieutenant; Imust to the watch.CASSIO: Good night, honest Iago.Exit


IAGO

And what's he then that says I play the villain?When this advice is free I give and honest,Probal to thinking and indeed the courseTo win the Moor again? For 'tis most easyThe inclining Desdemona to subdueIn any honest suit: she's framed as fruitfulAs the free elements. And then for herTo win the Moor--were't to renounce his baptism,All seals and symbols of redeemed sin,His soul is so enfetter'd to her love,That she may make, unmake, do what she list,Even as her appetite shall play the godWith his weak function. How am I then a villainTo counsel Cassio to this parallel course,Directly to his good? Divinity of hell!When devils will the blackest sins put on,They do suggest at first with heavenly shows,As I do now: for whiles this honest foolPlies Desdemona to repair his fortunesAnd she for him pleads strongly to the Moor,I'll pour this pestilence into his ear,That she repeals him for her body's lust;And by how much she strives to do him good,She shall undo her credit with the Moor.So will I turn her virtue into pitch,And out of her own goodness make the netThat shall enmesh them all.Re-enter RODERIGO
How now, Roderigo!

RODERIGO

I do follow here in the chase, not like a hound thathunts, but one that fills up the cry. My money isalmost spent; I have been to-night exceedingly wellcudgelled; and I think the issue will be, I shallhave so much experience for my pains, and so, withno money at all and a little more wit, return again to Venice.

IAGO

How poor are they that have not patience!What wound did ever heal but by degrees?Thou know'st we work by wit, and not by witchcraft;And wit depends on dilatory time.Does't not go well? Cassio hath beaten thee.And thou, by that small hurt, hast cashier'd Cassio:Though other things grow fair against the sun,Yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe:Content thyself awhile. By the mass, 'tis morning;Pleasure and action make the hours seem short.Retire thee; go where thou art billeted:Away, I say; thou shalt know more hereafter:Nay, get thee gone.Exit RODERIGO
Two things are to be done:My wife must move for Cassio to her mistress;I'll set her on;Myself the while to draw the Moor apart,And bring him jump when he may Cassio findSoliciting his wife: ay, that's the wayDull not device by coldness and delay.Exit

ACT III
SCENE I. Before the castle.

Enter CASSIO and some Musicians


CASSIO

Masters, play here; I will content your pains;Something that's brief; and bid 'Good morrow, general.'Music
Enter Clown


Clown

Why masters, have your instruments been in Naples,that they speak i' the nose thus?

First Musician

How, sir, how!

Clown

Are these, I pray you, wind-instruments?

First Musician

Ay, marry, are they, sir.

Clown

O, thereby hangs a tail.

First Musician

Whereby hangs a tale, sir?

Clown

Marry. sir, by many a wind-instrument that I know.But, masters, here's money for you: and the generalso likes your music, that he desires you, for love'ssake, to make no more noise with it.

First Musician

Well, sir, we will not.

Clown

If you have any music that may not be heard, to'tagain: but, as they say to hear music the generaldoes not greatly care.

First Musician

We have none such, sir.

Clown

Then put up your pipes in your bag, for I'll away:go; vanish into air; away!Exeunt Musicians


CASSIO

Dost thou hear, my honest friend?

Clown

No, I hear not your honest friend; I hear you.

CASSIO

Prithee, keep up thy quillets. There's a poor pieceof gold for thee: if the gentlewoman that attendsthe general's wife be stirring, tell her there'sone Cassio entreats her a little favour of speech:wilt thou do this?

Clown

She is stirring, sir: if she will stir hither, Ishall seem to notify unto her.

CASSIO

Do, good my friend.Exit Clown
Enter IAGO
In happy time, Iago.

IAGO

You have not been a-bed, then?

CASSIO

Why, no; the day had brokeBefore we parted. I have made bold, Iago,To send in to your wife: my suit to herIs, that she will to virtuous DesdemonaProcure me some access.

IAGO

I'll send her to you presently;And I'll devise a mean to draw the MoorOut of the way, that your converse and businessMay be more free.

CASSIO

I humbly thank you for't.Exit IAGO
I never knewA Florentine more kind and honest.Enter EMILIA


EMILIA

Good morrow, good Lieutenant: I am sorryFor your displeasure; but all will sure be well.The general and his wife are talking of it;And she speaks for you stoutly: the Moor replies,That he you hurt is of great fame in Cyprus,And great affinity, and that in wholesome wisdomHe might not but refuse you; but he protests he loves youAnd needs no other suitor but his likingsTo take the safest occasion by the frontTo bring you in again.

CASSIO

Yet, I beseech you,If you think fit, or that it may be done,Give me advantage of some brief discourseWith Desdemona alone.

EMILIA

Pray you, come in;I will bestow you where you shall have timeTo speak your bosom freely.

CASSIO

I am much bound to you.Exeunt

SCENE II. A room in the castle.

Enter OTHELLO, IAGO, and Gentlemen


OTHELLO

These letters give, Iago, to the pilot;And by him do my duties to the senate:That done, I will be walking on the works;Repair there to me.

IAGO

Well, my good lord, I'll do't.

OTHELLO

This fortification, gentlemen, shall we see't?

Gentleman

We'll wait upon your lordship.Exeunt

SCENE III. The garden of the castle.

Enter DESDEMONA, CASSIO, and EMILIA


DESDEMONA

Be thou assured, good Cassio, I will doAll my abilities in thy behalf.

EMILIA

Good madam, do: I warrant it grieves my husband,As if the case were his.

DESDEMONA

O, that's an honest fellow. Do not doubt, Cassio,But I will have my lord and you againAs friendly as you were.

CASSIO

Bounteous madam,Whatever shall become of Michael Cassio,He's never any thing but your true servant.

DESDEMONA

I know't; I thank you. You do love my lord:You have known him long; and be you well assuredHe shall in strangeness stand no further offThan in a polite distance.

CASSIO

Ay, but, lady,That policy may either last so long,Or feed upon such nice and waterish diet,Or breed itself so out of circumstance,That, I being absent and my place supplied,My general will forget my love and service.

DESDEMONA

Do not doubt that; before Emilia hereI give thee warrant of thy place: assure thee,If I do vow a friendship, I'll perform itTo the last article: my lord shall never rest;I'll watch him tame and talk him out of patience;His bed shall seem a school, his board a shrift;I'll intermingle every thing he doesWith Cassio's suit: therefore be merry, Cassio;For thy solicitor shall rather dieThan give thy cause away.

EMILIA

Madam, here comes my lord.

CASSIO

Madam, I'll take my leave.

DESDEMONA

Why, stay, and hear me speak.

CASSIO

Madam, not now: I am very ill at ease,Unfit for mine own purposes.

DESDEMONA

Well, do your discretion.Exit CASSIO
Enter OTHELLO and IAGO


IAGO

Ha! I like not that.

OTHELLO

What dost thou say?

IAGO

Nothing, my lord: or if--I know not what.

OTHELLO

Was not that Cassio parted from my wife?

IAGO

Cassio, my lord! No, sure, I cannot think it,That he would steal away so guilty-like,Seeing you coming.

OTHELLO

                  I do believe 'twas he.

DESDEMONA

How now, my lord!I have been talking with a suitor here,A man that languishes in your displeasure.

OTHELLO

Who is't you mean?

DESDEMONA

Why, your lieutenant, Cassio. Good my lord,If I have any grace or power to move you,His present reconciliation take;For if he be not one that truly loves you,That errs in ignorance and not in cunning,I have no judgment in an honest face:I prithee, call him back.

OTHELLO

Went he hence now?

DESDEMONA

Ay, sooth; so humbledThat he hath left part of his grief with me,To suffer with him. Good love, call him back.

OTHELLO

Not now, sweet Desdemona; some other time.

DESDEMONA

But shall't be shortly?

OTHELLO

The sooner, sweet, for you.

DESDEMONA

Shall't be to-night at supper?

OTHELLO

No, not to-night.

DESDEMONA

To-morrow dinner, then?

OTHELLO

I shall not dine at home;I meet the captains at the citadel.

DESDEMONA

Why, then, to-morrow night; or Tuesday morn;On Tuesday noon, or night; on Wednesday morn:I prithee, name the time, but let it notExceed three days: in faith, he's penitent;And yet his trespass, in our common reason--Save that, they say, the wars must make examplesOut of their best--is not almost a faultTo incur a private cheque. When shall he come?Tell me, Othello: I wonder in my soul,What you would ask me, that I should deny,Or stand so mammering on. What! Michael Cassio,That came a-wooing with you, and so many a time,When I have spoke of you dispraisingly,Hath ta'en your part; to have so much to doTo bring him in! Trust me, I could do much,--

OTHELLO

Prithee, no more: let him come when he will;I will deny thee nothing.

DESDEMONA

Why, this is not a boon;'Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves,Or feed on nourishing dishes, or keep you warm,Or sue to you to do a peculiar profitTo your own person: nay, when I have a suitWherein I mean to touch your love indeed,It shall be full of poise and difficult weightAnd fearful to be granted.

OTHELLO

I will deny thee nothing:Whereon, I do beseech thee, grant me this,To leave me but a little to myself.

DESDEMONA

Shall I deny you? no: farewell, my lord.

OTHELLO

Farewell, my Desdemona: I'll come to thee straight.

DESDEMONA

Emilia, come. Be as your fancies teach you;Whate'er you be, I am obedient.Exeunt DESDEMONA and EMILIA


OTHELLO

Excellent wretch! Perdition catch my soul,But I do love thee! and when I love thee not,Chaos is come again.

IAGO

My noble lord--

OTHELLO

                  What dost thou say, Iago?

IAGO

Did Michael Cassio, when you woo'd my lady,Know of your love?

OTHELLO

He did, from first to last: why dost thou ask?

IAGO

But for a satisfaction of my thought;No further harm.

OTHELLO

                  Why of thy thought, Iago?

IAGO

I did not think he had been acquainted with her.

OTHELLO

O, yes; and went between us very oft.

IAGO

Indeed!

OTHELLO

Indeed! ay, indeed: discern'st thou aught in that?Is he not honest?

IAGO

Honest, my lord!

OTHELLO

                  Honest! ay, honest.

IAGO

My lord, for aught I know.

OTHELLO

What dost thou think?

IAGO

Think, my lord!

OTHELLO

Think, my lord!By heaven, he echoes me,As if there were some monster in his thoughtToo hideous to be shown. Thou dost mean something:I heard thee say even now, thou likedst not that,When Cassio left my wife: what didst not like?And when I told thee he was of my counselIn my whole course of wooing, thou criedst 'Indeed!'And didst contract and purse thy brow together,As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brainSome horrible conceit: if thou dost love me,Show me thy thought.

IAGO

My lord, you know I love you.

OTHELLO

I think thou dost;And, for I know thou'rt full of love and honesty,And weigh'st thy words before thou givest them breath,Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more:For such things in a false disloyal knaveAre tricks of custom, but in a man that's justThey are close delations, working from the heartThat passion cannot rule.

IAGO

For Michael Cassio,I dare be sworn I think that he is honest.

OTHELLO

I think so too.

IAGO

                  Men should be what they seem;Or those that be not, would they might seem none!

OTHELLO

Certain, men should be what they seem.

IAGO

Why, then, I think Cassio's an honest man.

OTHELLO

Nay, yet there's more in this:I prithee, speak to me as to thy thinkings,As thou dost ruminate, and give thy worst of thoughtsThe worst of words.

IAGO

Good my lord, pardon me:Though I am bound to every act of duty,I am not bound to that all slaves are free to.Utter my thoughts? Why, say they are vile and false;As where's that palace whereinto foul thingsSometimes intrude not? who has a breast so pure,But some uncleanly apprehensionsKeep leets and law-days and in session sitWith meditations lawful?

OTHELLO

Thou dost conspire against thy friend, Iago,If thou but think'st him wrong'd and makest his earA stranger to thy thoughts.

IAGO

I do beseech you--Though I perchance am vicious in my guess,As, I confess, it is my nature's plagueTo spy into abuses, and oft my jealousyShapes faults that are not--that your wisdom yet,From one that so imperfectly conceits,Would take no notice, nor build yourself a troubleOut of his scattering and unsure observance.It were not for your quiet nor your good,Nor for my manhood, honesty, or wisdom,To let you know my thoughts.

OTHELLO

What dost thou mean?

IAGO

Good name in man and woman, dear my lord,Is the immediate jewel of their souls:Who steals my purse steals trash; 'tis something, nothing;'Twas mine, 'tis his, and has been slave to thousands:But he that filches from me my good nameRobs me of that which not enriches himAnd makes me poor indeed.

OTHELLO

By heaven, I'll know thy thoughts.

IAGO

You cannot, if my heart were in your hand;Nor shall not, whilst 'tis in my custody.

OTHELLO

Ha!

IAGO

O, beware, my lord, of jealousy;It is the green-eyed monster which doth mockThe meat it feeds on; that cuckold lives in blissWho, certain of his fate, loves not his wronger;But, O, what damned minutes tells he o'erWho dotes, yet doubts, suspects, yet strongly loves!

OTHELLO

O misery!

IAGO

Poor and content is rich and rich enough,But riches fineless is as poor as winterTo him that ever fears he shall be poor.Good heaven, the souls of all my tribe defendFrom jealousy!

OTHELLO

                  Why, why is this?Think'st thou I'ld make a lie of jealousy,To follow still the changes of the moonWith fresh suspicions? No; to be once in doubtIs once to be resolved: exchange me for a goat,When I shall turn the business of my soulTo such exsufflicate and blown surmises,Matching thy inference. 'Tis not to make me jealousTo say my wife is fair, feeds well, loves company,Is free of speech, sings, plays and dances well;Where virtue is, these are more virtuous:Nor from mine own weak merits will I drawThe smallest fear or doubt of her revolt;For she had eyes, and chose me. No, Iago;I'll see before I doubt; when I doubt, prove;And on the proof, there is no more but this,--Away at once with love or jealousy!

IAGO

I am glad of it; for now I shall have reasonTo show the love and duty that I bear youWith franker spirit: therefore, as I am bound,Receive it from me. I speak not yet of proof.Look to your wife; observe her well with Cassio;Wear your eye thus, not jealous nor secure:I would not have your free and noble nature,Out of self-bounty, be abused; look to't:I know our country disposition well;In Venice they do let heaven see the pranksThey dare not show their husbands; their best conscienceIs not to leave't undone, but keep't unknown.

OTHELLO

Dost thou say so?

IAGO

She did deceive her father, marrying you;And when she seem'd to shake and fear your looks,She loved them most.

OTHELLO

And so she did.

IAGO

Why, go to then;She that, so young, could give out such a seeming,To seal her father's eyes up close as oak-He thought 'twas witchcraft--but I am much to blame;I humbly do beseech you of your pardonFor too much loving you.

OTHELLO

I am bound to thee for ever.

IAGO

I see this hath a little dash'd your spirits.

OTHELLO

Not a jot, not a jot.

IAGO

I' faith, I fear it has.I hope you will consider what is spokeComes from my love. But I do see you're moved:I am to pray you not to strain my speechTo grosser issues nor to larger reachThan to suspicion.

OTHELLO

I will not.

IAGO

          Should you do so, my lord,My speech should fall into such vile successAs my thoughts aim not at. Cassio's my worthy friend--My lord, I see you're moved.

OTHELLO

No, not much moved:I do not think but Desdemona's honest.

IAGO

Long live she so! and long live you to think so!

OTHELLO

And yet, how nature erring from itself,--

IAGO

Ay, there's the point: as--to be bold with you--Not to affect many proposed matchesOf her own clime, complexion, and degree,Whereto we see in all things nature tends--Foh! one may smell in such a will most rank,Foul disproportion thoughts unnatural.But pardon me; I do not in positionDistinctly speak of her; though I may fearHer will, recoiling to her better judgment,May fall to match you with her country formsAnd happily repent.

OTHELLO

Farewell, farewell:If more thou dost perceive, let me know more;Set on thy wife to observe: leave me, Iago:

IAGO

[Going]  My lord, I take my leave.

OTHELLO

Why did I marry? This honest creature doubtlessSees and knows more, much more, than he unfolds.

IAGO

[Returning]  My lord, I would I might entreatyour honourTo scan this thing no further; leave it to time:Though it be fit that Cassio have his place,For sure, he fills it up with great ability,Yet, if you please to hold him off awhile,You shall by that perceive him and his means:Note, if your lady strain his entertainmentWith any strong or vehement importunity;Much will be seen in that. In the mean time,Let me be thought too busy in my fears--As worthy cause I have to fear I am--And hold her free, I do beseech your honour.

OTHELLO

Fear not my government.

IAGO

I once more take my leave.Exit


OTHELLO

This fellow's of exceeding honesty,And knows all qualities, with a learned spirit,Of human dealings. If I do prove her haggard,Though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings,I'ld whistle her off and let her down the wind,To pray at fortune. Haply, for I am blackAnd have not those soft parts of conversationThat chamberers have, or for I am declinedInto the vale of years,--yet that's not much--She's gone. I am abused; and my reliefMust be to loathe her. O curse of marriage,That we can call these delicate creatures ours,And not their appetites! I had rather be a toad,And live upon the vapour of a dungeon,Than keep a corner in the thing I loveFor others' uses. Yet, 'tis the plague of great ones;Prerogatived are they less than the base;'Tis destiny unshunnable, like death:Even then this forked plague is fated to usWhen we do quicken. Desdemona comes:Re-enter DESDEMONA and EMILIA
If she be false, O, then heaven mocks itself!I'll not believe't.

DESDEMONA

How now, my dear Othello!Your dinner, and the generous islandersBy you invited, do attend your presence.

OTHELLO

I am to blame.

DESDEMONA

                  Why do you speak so faintly?Are you not well?

OTHELLO

I have a pain upon my forehead here.

DESDEMONA

'Faith, that's with watching; 'twill away again:Let me but bind it hard, within this hourIt will be well.

OTHELLO

                  Your napkin is too little:He puts the handkerchief from him; and it drops
Let it alone. Come, I'll go in with you.

DESDEMONA

I am very sorry that you are not well.Exeunt OTHELLO and DESDEMONA


EMILIA

I am glad I have found this napkin:This was her first remembrance from the Moor:My wayward husband hath a hundred timesWoo'd me to steal it; but she so loves the token,For he conjured her she should ever keep it,That she reserves it evermore about herTo kiss and talk to. I'll have the work ta'en out,And give't Iago: what he will do with itHeaven knows, not I;I nothing but to please his fantasy.Re-enter Iago


IAGO

How now! what do you here alone?

EMILIA

Do not you chide; I have a thing for you.

IAGO

A thing for me? it is a common thing--

EMILIA

Ha!

IAGO

To have a foolish wife.

EMILIA

O, is that all? What will you give me nowFor the same handkerchief?

IAGO

What handkerchief?

EMILIA

What handkerchief?Why, that the Moor first gave to Desdemona;That which so often you did bid me steal.

IAGO

Hast stol'n it from her?

EMILIA

No, 'faith; she let it drop by negligence.And, to the advantage, I, being here, took't up.Look, here it is.

IAGO

                  A good wench; give it me.

EMILIA

What will you do with 't, that you have beenso earnestTo have me filch it?

IAGO

[Snatching it]  Why, what's that to you?

EMILIA

If it be not for some purpose of import,Give't me again: poor lady, she'll run madWhen she shall lack it.

IAGO

Be not acknown on 't; I have use for it.Go, leave me.Exit EMILIA
I will in Cassio's lodging lose this napkin,And let him find it. Trifles light as airAre to the jealous confirmations strongAs proofs of holy writ: this may do something.The Moor already changes with my poison:Dangerous conceits are, in their natures, poisons.Which at the first are scarce found to distaste,But with a little act upon the blood.Burn like the mines of Sulphur. I did say so:Look, where he comes!Re-enter OTHELLO
Not poppy, nor mandragora,Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world,Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleepWhich thou owedst yesterday.

OTHELLO

Ha! ha! false to me?

IAGO

Why, how now, general! no more of that.

OTHELLO

Avaunt! be gone! thou hast set me on the rack:I swear 'tis better to be much abusedThan but to know't a little.

IAGO

How now, my lord!

OTHELLO

What sense had I of her stol'n hours of lust?I saw't not, thought it not, it harm'd not me:I slept the next night well, was free and merry;I found not Cassio's kisses on her lips:He that is robb'd, not wanting what is stol'n,Let him not know't, and he's not robb'd at all.

IAGO

I am sorry to hear this.

OTHELLO

I had been happy, if the general camp,Pioners and all, had tasted her sweet body,So I had nothing known. O, now, for everFarewell the tranquil mind! farewell content!Farewell the plumed troop, and the big wars,That make ambition virtue! O, farewell!Farewell the neighing steed, and the shrill trump,The spirit-stirring drum, the ear-piercing fife,The royal banner, and all quality,Pride, pomp and circumstance of glorious war!And, O you mortal engines, whose rude throatsThe immortal Jove's dead clamours counterfeit,Farewell! Othello's occupation's gone!

IAGO

Is't possible, my lord?

OTHELLO

Villain, be sure thou prove my love a whore,Be sure of it; give me the ocular proof:Or by the worth of man's eternal soul,Thou hadst been better have been born a dogThan answer my waked wrath!

IAGO

Is't come to this?

OTHELLO

Make me to see't; or, at the least, so prove it,That the probation bear no hinge nor loopTo hang a doubt on; or woe upon thy life!

IAGO

My noble lord,--

OTHELLO

If thou dost slander her and torture me,Never pray more; abandon all remorse;On horror's head horrors accumulate;Do deeds to make heaven weep, all earth amazed;For nothing canst thou to damnation addGreater than that.

IAGO

                  O grace! O heaven forgive me!Are you a man? have you a soul or sense?God be wi' you; take mine office. O wretched fool.That livest to make thine honesty a vice!O monstrous world! Take note, take note, O world,To be direct and honest is not safe.I thank you for this profit; and from henceI'll love no friend, sith love breeds such offence.

OTHELLO

Nay, stay: thou shouldst be honest.

IAGO

I should be wise, for honesty's a foolAnd loses that it works for.

OTHELLO

By the world,I think my wife be honest and think she is not;I think that thou art just and think thou art not.I'll have some proof. Her name, that was as freshAs Dian's visage, is now begrimed and blackAs mine own face. If there be cords, or knives,Poison, or fire, or suffocating streams,I'll not endure it. Would I were satisfied!

IAGO

I see, sir, you are eaten up with passion:I do repent me that I put it to you.You would be satisfied?

OTHELLO

Would! nay, I will.

IAGO

And may: but, how? how satisfied, my lord?Would you, the supervisor, grossly gape on--Behold her topp'd?

OTHELLO

                  Death and damnation! O!

IAGO

It were a tedious difficulty, I think,To bring them to that prospect: damn them then,If ever mortal eyes do see them bolsterMore than their own! What then? how then?What shall I say? Where's satisfaction?It is impossible you should see this,Were they as prime as goats, as hot as monkeys,As salt as wolves in pride, and fools as grossAs ignorance made drunk. But yet, I say,If imputation and strong circumstances,Which lead directly to the door of truth,Will give you satisfaction, you may have't.

OTHELLO

Give me a living reason she's disloyal.

IAGO

I do not like the office:But, sith I am enter'd in this cause so far,Prick'd to't by foolish honesty and love,I will go on. I lay with Cassio lately;And, being troubled with a raging tooth,I could not sleep.There are a kind of men so loose of soul,That in their sleeps will mutter their affairs:One of this kind is Cassio:In sleep I heard him say 'Sweet Desdemona,Let us be wary, let us hide our loves;'And then, sir, would he gripe and wring my hand,Cry 'O sweet creature!' and then kiss me hard,As if he pluck'd up kisses by the rootsThat grew upon my lips: then laid his legOver my thigh, and sigh'd, and kiss'd; and thenCried 'Cursed fate that gave thee to the Moor!'

OTHELLO

O monstrous! monstrous!

IAGO

Nay, this was but his dream.

OTHELLO

But this denoted a foregone conclusion:'Tis a shrewd doubt, though it be but a dream.

IAGO

And this may help to thicken other proofsThat do demonstrate thinly.

OTHELLO

I'll tear her all to pieces.

IAGO

Nay, but be wise: yet we see nothing done;She may be honest yet. Tell me but this,Have you not sometimes seen a handkerchiefSpotted with strawberries in your wife's hand?

OTHELLO

I gave her such a one; 'twas my first gift.

IAGO

I know not that; but such a handkerchief--I am sure it was your wife's--did I to-daySee Cassio wipe his beard with.

OTHELLO

If it be that--

IAGO

If it be that, or any that was hers,It speaks against her with the other proofs.

OTHELLO

O, that the slave had forty thousand lives!One is too poor, too weak for my revenge.Now do I see 'tis true. Look here, Iago;All my fond love thus do I blow to heaven.'Tis gone.Arise, black vengeance, from thy hollow cell!Yield up, O love, thy crown and hearted throneTo tyrannous hate! Swell, bosom, with thy fraught,For 'tis of aspics' tongues!

IAGO

Yet be content.

OTHELLO

O, blood, blood, blood!

IAGO

Patience, I say; your mind perhaps may change.

OTHELLO

Never, Iago: Like to the Pontic sea,Whose icy current and compulsive courseNe'er feels retiring ebb, but keeps due onTo the Propontic and the Hellespont,Even so my bloody thoughts, with violent pace,Shall ne'er look back, ne'er ebb to humble love,Till that a capable and wide revengeSwallow them up. Now, by yond marble heaven,Kneels
In the due reverence of a sacred vowI here engage my words.

IAGO

Do not rise yet.Kneels
Witness, you ever-burning lights above,You elements that clip us round about,Witness that here Iago doth give upThe execution of his wit, hands, heart,To wrong'd Othello's service! Let him command,And to obey shall be in me remorse,What bloody business ever.They rise


OTHELLO

I greet thy love,Not with vain thanks, but with acceptance bounteous,And will upon the instant put thee to't:Within these three days let me hear thee sayThat Cassio's not alive.

IAGO

My friend is dead; 'tis done at your request:But let her live.

OTHELLO

Damn her, lewd minx! O, damn her!Come, go with me apart; I will withdraw,To furnish me with some swift means of deathFor the fair devil. Now art thou my lieutenant.

IAGO

I am your own for ever.Exeunt

SCENE IV. Before the castle.

Enter DESDEMONA, EMILIA, and Clown


DESDEMONA

Do you know, sirrah, where Lieutenant Cassio lies?

Clown

I dare not say he lies any where.

DESDEMONA

Why, man?

Clown

He's a soldier, and for one to say a soldier lies,is stabbing.

DESDEMONA

Go to: where lodges he?

Clown

To tell you where he lodges, is to tell you where I lie.

DESDEMONA

Can any thing be made of this?

Clown

I know not where he lodges, and for me to devise alodging and say he lies here or he lies there, wereto lie in mine own throat.

DESDEMONA

Can you inquire him out, and be edified by report?

Clown

I will catechise the world for him; that is, makequestions, and by them answer.

DESDEMONA

Seek him, bid him come hither: tell him I havemoved my lord on his behalf, and hope all will be well.

Clown

To do this is within the compass of man's wit: andtherefore I will attempt the doing it.Exit


DESDEMONA

Where should I lose that handkerchief, Emilia?

EMILIA

I know not, madam.

DESDEMONA

Believe me, I had rather have lost my purseFull of crusadoes: and, but my noble MoorIs true of mind and made of no such basenessAs jealous creatures are, it were enoughTo put him to ill thinking.

EMILIA

Is he not jealous?

DESDEMONA

Who, he? I think the sun where he was bornDrew all such humours from him.

EMILIA

Look, where he comes.

DESDEMONA

I will not leave him now till CassioBe call'd to him.Enter OTHELLO
How is't with you, my lord

OTHELLO

Well, my good lady.Aside
O, hardness to dissemble!--How do you, Desdemona?

DESDEMONA

Well, my good lord.

OTHELLO

Give me your hand: this hand is moist, my lady.

DESDEMONA

It yet hath felt no age nor known no sorrow.

OTHELLO

This argues fruitfulness and liberal heart:Hot, hot, and moist: this hand of yours requiresA sequester from liberty, fasting and prayer,Much castigation, exercise devout;For here's a young and sweating devil here,That commonly rebels. 'Tis a good hand,A frank one.

DESDEMONA

                  You may, indeed, say so;For 'twas that hand that gave away my heart.

OTHELLO

A liberal hand: the hearts of old gave hands;But our new heraldry is hands, not hearts.

DESDEMONA

I cannot speak of this. Come now, your promise.

OTHELLO

What promise, chuck?

DESDEMONA

I have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you.

OTHELLO

I have a salt and sorry rheum offends me;Lend me thy handkerchief.

DESDEMONA

Here, my lord.

OTHELLO

That which I gave you.

DESDEMONA

I have it not about me.

OTHELLO

Not?

DESDEMONA

   No, indeed, my lord.

OTHELLO

That is a fault.That handkerchiefDid an Egyptian to my mother give;She was a charmer, and could almost readThe thoughts of people: she told her, whileshe kept it,'Twould make her amiable and subdue my fatherEntirely to her love, but if she lost itOr made gift of it, my father's eyeShould hold her loathed and his spirits should huntAfter new fancies: she, dying, gave it me;And bid me, when my fate would have me wive,To give it her. I did so: and take heed on't;Make it a darling like your precious eye;To lose't or give't away were such perditionAs nothing else could match.

DESDEMONA

Is't possible?

OTHELLO

'Tis true: there's magic in the web of it:A sibyl, that had number'd in the worldThe sun to course two hundred compasses,In her prophetic fury sew'd the work;The worms were hallow'd that did breed the silk;And it was dyed in mummy which the skilfulConserved of maidens' hearts.

DESDEMONA

Indeed! is't true?

OTHELLO

Most veritable; therefore look to't well.

DESDEMONA

Then would to God that I had never seen't!

OTHELLO

Ha! wherefore?

DESDEMONA

Why do you speak so startingly and rash?

OTHELLO

Is't lost? is't gone? speak, is it outo' the way?

DESDEMONA

Heaven bless us!

OTHELLO

Say you?

DESDEMONA

It is not lost; but what an if it were?

OTHELLO

How!

DESDEMONA

I say, it is not lost.

OTHELLO

Fetch't, let me see't.

DESDEMONA

Why, so I can, sir, but I will not now.This is a trick to put me from my suit:Pray you, let Cassio be received again.

OTHELLO

Fetch me the handkerchief: my mind misgives.

DESDEMONA

Come, come;You'll never meet a more sufficient man.

OTHELLO

The handkerchief!

DESDEMONA

                  I pray, talk me of Cassio.

OTHELLO

The handkerchief!

DESDEMONA

                  A man that all his timeHath founded his good fortunes on your love,Shared dangers with you,--

OTHELLO

The handkerchief!

DESDEMONA

In sooth, you are to blame.

OTHELLO

Away!Exit


EMILIA

Is not this man jealous?

DESDEMONA

I ne'er saw this before.Sure, there's some wonder in this handkerchief:I am most unhappy in the loss of it.

EMILIA

'Tis not a year or two shows us a man:They are all but stomachs, and we all but food;To eat us hungerly, and when they are full,They belch us. Look you, Cassio and my husband!Enter CASSIO and IAGO


IAGO

There is no other way; 'tis she must do't:And, lo, the happiness! go, and importune her.

DESDEMONA

How now, good Cassio! what's the news with you?

CASSIO

Madam, my former suit: I do beseech youThat by your virtuous means I may againExist, and be a member of his loveWhom I with all the office of my heartEntirely honour: I would not be delay'd.If my offence be of such mortal kindThat nor my service past, nor present sorrows,Nor purposed merit in futurity,Can ransom me into his love again,But to know so must be my benefit;So shall I clothe me in a forced content,And shut myself up in some other course,To fortune's alms.

DESDEMONA

                  Alas, thrice-gentle Cassio!My advocation is not now in tune;My lord is not my lord; nor should I know him,Were he in favour as in humour alter'd.So help me every spirit sanctified,As I have spoken for you all my bestAnd stood within the blank of his displeasureFor my free speech! you must awhile be patient:What I can do I will; and more I willThan for myself I dare: let that suffice you.

IAGO

Is my lord angry?

EMILIA

                  He went hence but now,And certainly in strange unquietness.

IAGO

Can he be angry? I have seen the cannon,When it hath blown his ranks into the air,And, like the devil, from his very armPuff'd his own brother:--and can he be angry?Something of moment then: I will go meet him:There's matter in't indeed, if he be angry.

DESDEMONA

I prithee, do so.Exit IAGO
Something, sure, of state,Either from Venice, or some unhatch'd practiseMade demonstrable here in Cyprus to him,Hath puddled his clear spirit: and in such casesMen's natures wrangle with inferior things,Though great ones are their object. 'Tis even so;For let our finger ache, and it induesOur other healthful members even to that senseOf pain: nay, we must think men are not gods,Nor of them look for such observancesAs fit the bridal. Beshrew me much, Emilia,I was, unhandsome warrior as I am,Arraigning his unkindness with my soul;But now I find I had suborn'd the witness,And he's indicted falsely.

EMILIA

Pray heaven it be state-matters, as you think,And no conception nor no jealous toyConcerning you.

DESDEMONA

Alas the day! I never gave him cause.

EMILIA

But jealous souls will not be answer'd so;They are not ever jealous for the cause,But jealous for they are jealous: 'tis a monsterBegot upon itself, born on itself.

DESDEMONA

Heaven keep that monster from Othello's mind!

EMILIA

Lady, amen.

DESDEMONA

I will go seek him. Cassio, walk hereabout:If I do find him fit, I'll move your suitAnd seek to effect it to my uttermost.

CASSIO

I humbly thank your ladyship.Exeunt DESDEMONA and EMILIA
Enter BIANCA


BIANCA

Save you, friend Cassio!

CASSIO

What make you from home?How is it with you, my most fair Bianca?I' faith, sweet love, I was coming to your house.

BIANCA

And I was going to your lodging, Cassio.What, keep a week away? seven days and nights?Eight score eight hours? and lovers' absent hours,More tedious than the dial eight score times?O weary reckoning!

CASSIO

                  Pardon me, Bianca:I have this while with leaden thoughts been press'd:But I shall, in a more continuate time,Strike off this score of absence. Sweet Bianca,Giving her DESDEMONA's handkerchief
Take me this work out.

BIANCA

O Cassio, whence came this?This is some token from a newer friend:To the felt absence now I feel a cause:Is't come to this? Well, well.

CASSIO

Go to, woman!Throw your vile guesses in the devil's teeth,From whence you have them. You are jealous nowThat this is from some mistress, some remembrance:No, in good troth, Bianca.

BIANCA

Why, whose is it?

CASSIO

I know not, sweet: I found it in my chamber.I like the work well: ere it be demanded--As like enough it will--I'ld have it copied:Take it, and do't; and leave me for this time.

BIANCA

Leave you! wherefore?

CASSIO

I do attend here on the general;And think it no addition, nor my wish,To have him see me woman'd.

BIANCA

Why, I pray you?

CASSIO

Not that I love you not.

BIANCA

But that you do not love me.I pray you, bring me on the way a little,And say if I shall see you soon at night.

CASSIO

'Tis but a little way that I can bring you;For I attend here: but I'll see you soon.

BIANCA

'Tis very good; I must be circumstanced.Exeunt

ACT IV
SCENE I. Cyprus. Before the castle.

Enter OTHELLO and IAGO


IAGO

Will you think so?

OTHELLO

                  Think so, Iago!

IAGO

What,To kiss in private?

OTHELLO

An unauthorized kiss.

IAGO

Or to be naked with her friend in bedAn hour or more, not meaning any harm?

OTHELLO

Naked in bed, Iago, and not mean harm!It is hypocrisy against the devil:They that mean virtuously, and yet do so,The devil their virtue tempts, and they tempt heaven.

IAGO

So they do nothing, 'tis a venial slip:But if I give my wife a handkerchief,--

OTHELLO

What then?

IAGO

Why, then, 'tis hers, my lord; and, being hers,She may, I think, bestow't on any man.

OTHELLO

She is protectress of her honour too:May she give that?

IAGO

Her honour is an essence that's not seen;They have it very oft that have it not:But, for the handkerchief,--

OTHELLO

By heaven, I would most gladly have forgot it.Thou said'st, it comes o'er my memory,As doth the raven o'er the infected house,Boding to all--he had my handkerchief.

IAGO

Ay, what of that?

OTHELLO

                  That's not so good now.

IAGO

What,If I had said I had seen him do you wrong?Or heard him say,--as knaves be such abroad,Who having, by their own importunate suit,Or voluntary dotage of some mistress,Convinced or supplied them, cannot chooseBut they must blab--

OTHELLO

Hath he said any thing?

IAGO

He hath, my lord; but be you well assured,No more than he'll unswear.

OTHELLO

What hath he said?

IAGO

'Faith, that he did--I know not what he did.

OTHELLO

What? what?

IAGO

Lie--

OTHELLO

    With her?

IAGO

With her, on her; what you will.

OTHELLO

Lie with her! lie on her! We say lie on her, whenthey belie her. Lie with her! that's fulsome.--Handkerchief--confessions--handkerchief!--Toconfess, and be hanged for his labour;--first, to behanged, and then to confess.--I tremble at it.Nature would not invest herself in such shadowingpassion without some instruction. It is not wordsthat shake me thus. Pish! Noses, ears, and lips.--Is't possible?--Confess--handkerchief!--O devil!--Falls in a trance


IAGO

Work on,My medicine, work! Thus credulous fools are caught;And many worthy and chaste dames even thus,All guiltless, meet reproach. What, ho! my lord!My lord, I say! Othello!Enter CASSIO
How now, Cassio!

CASSIO

What's the matter?

IAGO

My lord is fall'n into an epilepsy:This is his second fit; he had one yesterday.

CASSIO

Rub him about the temples.

IAGO

No, forbear;The lethargy must have his quiet course:If not, he foams at mouth and by and byBreaks out to savage madness. Look he stirs:Do you withdraw yourself a little while,He will recover straight: when he is gone,I would on great occasion speak with you.Exit CASSIO
How is it, general? have you not hurt your head?

OTHELLO

Dost thou mock me?

IAGO

                  I mock you! no, by heaven.Would you would bear your fortune like a man!

OTHELLO

A horned man's a monster and a beast.

IAGO

There's many a beast then in a populous city,And many a civil monster.

OTHELLO

Did he confess it?

IAGO

                  Good sir, be a man;Think every bearded fellow that's but yokedMay draw with you: there's millions now aliveThat nightly lie in those unproper bedsWhich they dare swear peculiar: your case is better.O, 'tis the spite of hell, the fiend's arch-mock,To lip a wanton in a secure couch,And to suppose her chaste! No, let me know;And knowing what I am, I know what she shall be.

OTHELLO

O, thou art wise; 'tis certain.

IAGO

Stand you awhile apart;Confine yourself but in a patient list.Whilst you were here o'erwhelmed with your grief--A passion most unsuiting such a man--Cassio came hither: I shifted him away,And laid good 'scuse upon your ecstasy,Bade him anon return and here speak with me;The which he promised. Do but encave yourself,And mark the fleers, the gibes, and notable scorns,That dwell in every region of his face;For I will make him tell the tale anew,Where, how, how oft, how long ago, and whenHe hath, and is again to cope your wife:I say, but mark his gesture. Marry, patience;Or I shall say you are all in all in spleen,And nothing of a man.

OTHELLO

Dost thou hear, Iago?I will be found most cunning in my patience;But--dost thou hear?--most bloody.

IAGO

That's not amiss;But yet keep time in all. Will you withdraw?OTHELLO retires
Now will I question Cassio of Bianca,A housewife that by selling her desiresBuys herself bread and clothes: it is a creatureThat dotes on Cassio; as 'tis the strumpet's plagueTo beguile many and be beguiled by one:He, when he hears of her, cannot refrainFrom the excess of laughter. Here he comes:Re-enter CASSIO
As he shall smile, Othello shall go mad;And his unbookish jealousy must construePoor Cassio's smiles, gestures and light behavior,Quite in the wrong. How do you now, lieutenant?

CASSIO

The worser that you give me the additionWhose want even kills me.

IAGO

Ply Desdemona well, and you are sure on't.Speaking lower
Now, if this suit lay in Bianco's power,How quickly should you speed!

CASSIO

Alas, poor caitiff!

OTHELLO

Look, how he laughs already!

IAGO

I never knew woman love man so.

CASSIO

Alas, poor rogue! I think, i' faith, she loves me.

OTHELLO

Now he denies it faintly, and laughs it out.

IAGO

Do you hear, Cassio?

OTHELLO

Now he importunes himTo tell it o'er: go to; well said, well said.

IAGO

She gives it out that you shall marry hey:Do you intend it?

CASSIO

Ha, ha, ha!

OTHELLO

Do you triumph, Roman? do you triumph?

CASSIO

I marry her! what? a customer! Prithee, bear somecharity to my wit: do not think it so unwholesome.Ha, ha, ha!

OTHELLO

So, so, so, so: they laugh that win.

IAGO

'Faith, the cry goes that you shall marry her.

CASSIO

Prithee, say true.

IAGO

I am a very villain else.

OTHELLO

Have you scored me? Well.

CASSIO

This is the monkey's own giving out: she ispersuaded I will marry her, out of her own love andflattery, not out of my promise.

OTHELLO

Iago beckons me; now he begins the story.

CASSIO

She was here even now; she haunts me in every place.I was the other day talking on the sea-bank withcertain Venetians; and thither comes the bauble,and, by this hand, she falls me thus about my neck--

OTHELLO

Crying 'O dear Cassio!' as it were: his gestureimports it.

CASSIO

So hangs, and lolls, and weeps upon me; so hales,and pulls me: ha, ha, ha!

OTHELLO

Now he tells how she plucked him to my chamber. O,I see that nose of yours, but not that dog I shallthrow it to.

CASSIO

Well, I must leave her company.

IAGO

Before me! look, where she comes.

CASSIO

'Tis such another fitchew! marry a perfumed one.Enter BIANCA
What do you mean by this haunting of me?

BIANCA

Let the devil and his dam haunt you! What did youmean by that same handkerchief you gave me even now?I was a fine fool to take it. I must take out thework?--A likely piece of work, that you should findit in your chamber, and not know who left it there!This is some minx's token, and I must take out thework? There; give it your hobby-horse: wheresoeveryou had it, I'll take out no work on't.

CASSIO

How now, my sweet Bianca! how now! how now!

OTHELLO

By heaven, that should be my handkerchief!

BIANCA

An you'll come to supper to-night, you may; an youwill not, come when you are next prepared for.Exit


IAGO

After her, after her.

CASSIO

'Faith, I must; she'll rail in the street else.

IAGO

Will you sup there?

CASSIO

'Faith, I intend so.

IAGO

Well, I may chance to see you; for I would very fainspeak with you.

CASSIO

Prithee, come; will you?

IAGO

Go to; say no more.Exit CASSIO


OTHELLO

[Advancing]  How shall I murder him, Iago?

IAGO

Did you perceive how he laughed at his vice?

OTHELLO

O Iago!

IAGO

And did you see the handkerchief?

OTHELLO

Was that mine?

IAGO

Yours by this hand: and to see how he prizes thefoolish woman your wife! she gave it him, and hehath given it his whore.

OTHELLO

I would have him nine years a-killing.A fine woman! a fair woman! a sweet woman!

IAGO

Nay, you must forget that.

OTHELLO

Ay, let her rot, and perish, and be damned to-night;for she shall not live: no, my heart is turned tostone; I strike it, and it hurts my hand. O, theworld hath not a sweeter creature: she might lie byan emperor's side and command him tasks.

IAGO

Nay, that's not your way.

OTHELLO

Hang her! I do but say what she is: so delicatewith her needle: an admirable musician: O! shewill sing the savageness out of a bear: of so highand plenteous wit and invention:--

IAGO

She's the worse for all this.

OTHELLO

O, a thousand thousand times: and then, of sogentle a condition!

IAGO

Ay, too gentle.

OTHELLO

Nay, that's certain: but yet the pity of it, Iago!O Iago, the pity of it, Iago!

IAGO

If you are so fond over her iniquity, give herpatent to offend; for, if it touch not you, it comesnear nobody.

OTHELLO

I will chop her into messes: cuckold me!

IAGO

O, 'tis foul in her.

OTHELLO

With mine officer!

IAGO

That's fouler.

OTHELLO

Get me some poison, Iago; this night: I'll notexpostulate with her, lest her body and beautyunprovide my mind again: this night, Iago.

IAGO

Do it not with poison, strangle her in her bed, eventhe bed she hath contaminated.

OTHELLO

Good, good: the justice of it pleases: very good.

IAGO

And for Cassio, let me be his undertaker: youshall hear more by midnight.

OTHELLO

Excellent good.A trumpet within
What trumpet is that same?

IAGO

Something from Venice, sure. 'Tis LodovicoCome from the duke: and, see, your wife is with him.Enter LODOVICO, DESDEMONA, and Attendants


LODOVICO

Save you, worthy general!

OTHELLO

With all my heart, sir.

LODOVICO

The duke and senators of Venice greet you.Gives him a letter


OTHELLO

I kiss the instrument of their pleasures.Opens the letter, and reads


DESDEMONA

And what's the news, good cousin Lodovico?

IAGO

I am very glad to see you, signiorWelcome to Cyprus.

LODOVICO

I thank you. How does Lieutenant Cassio?

IAGO

Lives, sir.

DESDEMONA

Cousin, there's fall'n between him and my lordAn unkind breach: but you shall make all well.

OTHELLO

Are you sure of that?

DESDEMONA

My lord?

OTHELLO

[Reads]  'This fail you not to do, as you will--'

LODOVICO

He did not call; he's busy in the paper.Is there division 'twixt my lord and Cassio?

DESDEMONA

A most unhappy one: I would do muchTo atone them, for the love I bear to Cassio.

OTHELLO

Fire and brimstone!

DESDEMONA

My lord?

OTHELLO

       Are you wise?

DESDEMONA

What, is he angry?

LODOVICO

                  May be the letter moved him;For, as I think, they do command him home,Deputing Cassio in his government.

DESDEMONA

Trust me, I am glad on't.

OTHELLO

Indeed!

DESDEMONA

My lord?

OTHELLO

I am glad to see you mad.

DESDEMONA

Why, sweet Othello,--

OTHELLO

[Striking her]  Devil!

DESDEMONA

I have not deserved this.

LODOVICO

My lord, this would not be believed in Venice,Though I should swear I saw't: 'tis very much:Make her amends; she weeps.

OTHELLO

O devil, devil!If that the earth could teem with woman's tears,Each drop she falls would prove a crocodile.Out of my sight!

DESDEMONA

I will not stay to offend you.Going


LODOVICO

Truly, an obedient lady:I do beseech your lordship, call her back.

OTHELLO

Mistress!

DESDEMONA

        My lord?

OTHELLO

What would you with her, sir?

LODOVICO

Who, I, my lord?

OTHELLO

Ay; you did wish that I would make her turn:Sir, she can turn, and turn, and yet go on,And turn again; and she can weep, sir, weep;And she's obedient, as you say, obedient,Very obedient. Proceed you in your tears.Concerning this, sir,--O  well-painted passion!--I am commanded home. Get you away;I'll send for you anon. Sir, I obey the mandate,And will return to Venice. Hence, avaunt!Exit DESDEMONA
Cassio shall have my place. And, sir, tonight,I do entreat that we may sup together:You are welcome, sir, to Cyprus.--Goats and monkeys!Exit


LODOVICO

Is this the noble Moor whom our full senateCall all in all sufficient? Is this the natureWhom passion could not shake? whose solid virtueThe shot of accident, nor dart of chance,Could neither graze nor pierce?

IAGO

He is much changed.

LODOVICO

Are his wits safe? is he not light of brain?

IAGO

He's that he is: I may not breathe my censureWhat he might be: if what he might he is not,I would to heaven he were!

LODOVICO

What, strike his wife!

IAGO

'Faith, that was not so well; yet would I knewThat stroke would prove the worst!

LODOVICO

Is it his use?Or did the letters work upon his blood,And new-create this fault?

IAGO

Alas, alas!It is not honesty in me to speakWhat I have seen and known. You shall observe him,And his own courses will denote him soThat I may save my speech: do but go after,And mark how he continues.

LODOVICO

I am sorry that I am deceived in him.Exeunt

SCENE II. A room in the castle.

Enter OTHELLO and EMILIA


OTHELLO

You have seen nothing then?

EMILIA

Nor ever heard, nor ever did suspect.

OTHELLO

Yes, you have seen Cassio and she together.

EMILIA

But then I saw no harm, and then I heardEach syllable that breath made up between them.

OTHELLO

What, did they never whisper?

EMILIA

Never, my lord.

OTHELLO

Nor send you out o' the way?

EMILIA

Never.

OTHELLO

To fetch her fan, her gloves, her mask, nor nothing?

EMILIA

Never, my lord.

OTHELLO

That's strange.

EMILIA

I durst, my lord, to wager she is honest,Lay down my soul at stake: if you think other,Remove your thought; it doth abuse your bosom.If any wretch have put this in your head,Let heaven requite it with the serpent's curse!For, if she be not honest, chaste, and true,There's no man happy; the purest of their wivesIs foul as slander.

OTHELLO

Bid her come hither: go.Exit EMILIA
She says enough; yet she's a simple bawdThat cannot say as much. This is a subtle whore,A closet lock and key of villanous secretsAnd yet she'll kneel and pray; I have seen her do't.Enter DESDEMONA with EMILIA


DESDEMONA

My lord, what is your will?

OTHELLO

Pray, chuck, come hither.

DESDEMONA

What is your pleasure?

OTHELLO

Let me see your eyes;Look in my face.

DESDEMONA

                  What horrible fancy's this?

OTHELLO

[To EMILIA]  Some of your function, mistress;Leave procreants alone and shut the door;Cough, or cry 'hem,' if any body come:Your mystery, your mystery: nay, dispatch.Exit EMILIA


DESDEMONA

Upon my knees, what doth your speech import?I understand a fury in your words.But not the words.

OTHELLO

Why, what art thou?

DESDEMONA

Your wife, my lord; your trueAnd loyal wife.

OTHELLO

                  Come, swear it, damn thyselfLest, being like one of heaven, the devils themselvesShould fear to seize thee: therefore be double damn'd:Swear thou art honest.

DESDEMONA

Heaven doth truly know it.

OTHELLO

Heaven truly knows that thou art false as hell.

DESDEMONA

To whom, my lord? with whom? how am I false?

OTHELLO

O Desdemona! away! away! away!

DESDEMONA

Alas the heavy day! Why do you weep?Am I the motive of these tears, my lord?If haply you my father do suspectAn instrument of this your calling back,Lay not your blame on me: If you have lost him,Why, I have lost him too.

OTHELLO

Had it pleased heavenTo try me with affliction; had they rain'dAll kinds of sores and shames on my bare head.Steep'd me in poverty to the very lips,Given to captivity me and my utmost hopes,I should have found in some place of my soulA drop of patience: but, alas, to make meA fixed figure for the time of scornTo point his slow unmoving finger at!Yet could I bear that too; well, very well:But there, where I have garner'd up my heart,Where either I must live, or bear no life;The fountain from the which my current runs,Or else dries up; to be discarded thence!Or keep it as a cistern for foul toadsTo knot and gender in! Turn thy complexion there,Patience, thou young and rose-lipp'd cherubin,--Ay, there, look grim as hell!

DESDEMONA

I hope my noble lord esteems me honest.

OTHELLO

O, ay; as summer flies are in the shambles,That quicken even with blowing. O thou weed,Who art so lovely fair and smell'st so sweetThat the sense aches at thee, would thou hadstne'er been born!

DESDEMONA

Alas, what ignorant sin have I committed?

OTHELLO

Was this fair paper, this most goodly book,Made to write 'whore' upon? What committed!Committed! O thou public commoner!I should make very forges of my cheeks,That would to cinders burn up modesty,Did I but speak thy deeds. What committed!Heaven stops the nose at it and the moon winks,The bawdy wind that kisses all it meetsIs hush'd within the hollow mine of earth,And will not hear it. What committed!Impudent strumpet!

DESDEMONA

                  By heaven, you do me wrong.

OTHELLO

Are you not a strumpet?

DESDEMONA

No, as I am a Christian:If to preserve this vessel for my lordFrom any other foul unlawful touchBe not to be a strumpet, I am none.

OTHELLO

What, not a whore?

DESDEMONA

                  No, as I shall be saved.

OTHELLO

Is't possible?

DESDEMONA

                  O, heaven forgive us!

OTHELLO

I cry you mercy, then:I took you for that cunning whore of VeniceThat married with Othello.Raising his voice
You, mistress,That have the office opposite to Saint Peter,And keep the gate of hell!Re-enter EMILIA
You, you, ay, you!We have done our course; there's money for your pains:I pray you, turn the key and keep our counsel.Exit


EMILIA

Alas, what does this gentleman conceive?How do you, madam? how do you, my good lady?

DESDEMONA

'Faith, half asleep.

EMILIA

Good madam, what's the matter with my lord?

DESDEMONA

With who?

EMILIA

Why, with my lord, madam.

DESDEMONA

Who is thy lord?

EMILIA

                  He that is yours, sweet lady.

DESDEMONA

I have none: do not talk to me, Emilia;I cannot weep; nor answer have I none,But what should go by water. Prithee, tonightLay on my bed my wedding sheets: remember;And call thy husband hither.

EMILIA

Here's a change indeed!Exit


DESDEMONA

'Tis meet I should be used so, very meet.How have I been behaved, that he might stickThe small'st opinion on my least misuse?Re-enter EMILIA with IAGO


IAGO

What is your pleasure, madam?How is't with you?

DESDEMONA

I cannot tell. Those that do teach young babesDo it with gentle means and easy tasks:He might have chid me so; for, in good faith,I am a child to chiding.

IAGO

What's the matter, lady?

EMILIA

Alas, Iago, my lord hath so bewhored her.Thrown such despite and heavy terms upon her,As true hearts cannot bear.

DESDEMONA

Am I that name, Iago?

IAGO

What name, fair lady?

DESDEMONA

Such as she says my lord did say I was.

EMILIA

He call'd her whore: a beggar in his drinkCould not have laid such terms upon his callat.

IAGO

Why did he so?

DESDEMONA

I do not know; I am sure I am none such.

IAGO

Do not weep, do not weep. Alas the day!

EMILIA

Hath she forsook so many noble matches,Her father and her country and her friends,To be call'd whore? would it not make one weep?

DESDEMONA

It is my wretched fortune.

IAGO

Beshrew him for't!How comes this trick upon him?

DESDEMONA

Nay, heaven doth know.

EMILIA

I will be hang'd, if some eternal villain,Some busy and insinuating rogue,Some cogging, cozening slave, to get some office,Have not devised this slander; I'll be hang'd else.

IAGO

Fie, there is no such man; it is impossible.

DESDEMONA

If any such there be, heaven pardon him!

EMILIA

A halter pardon him! and hell gnaw his bones!Why should he call her whore? who keeps her company?What place? what time? what form? what likelihood?The Moor's abused by some most villanous knave,Some base notorious knave, some scurvy fellow.O heaven, that such companions thou'ldst unfold,And put in every honest hand a whipTo lash the rascals naked through the worldEven from the east to the west!

IAGO

Speak within door.

EMILIA

O, fie upon them! Some such squire he wasThat turn'd your wit the seamy side without,And made you to suspect me with the Moor.

IAGO

You are a fool; go to.

DESDEMONA

O good Iago,What shall I do to win my lord again?Good friend, go to him; for, by this light of heaven,I know not how I lost him. Here I kneel:If e'er my will did trespass 'gainst his love,Either in discourse of thought or actual deed,Or that mine eyes, mine ears, or any sense,Delighted them in any other form;Or that I do not yet, and ever did.And ever will--though he do shake me offTo beggarly divorcement--love him dearly,Comfort forswear me! Unkindness may do much;And his unkindness may defeat my life,But never taint my love. I cannot say 'whore:'It does abhor me now I speak the word;To do the act that might the addition earnNot the world's mass of vanity could make me.

IAGO

I pray you, be content; 'tis but his humour:The business of the state does him offence,And he does chide with you.

DESDEMONA

If 'twere no other--

IAGO

'Tis but so, I warrant.Trumpets within
Hark, how these instruments summon to supper!The messengers of Venice stay the meat;Go in, and weep not; all things shall be well.Exeunt DESDEMONA and EMILIA
Enter RODERIGO
How now, Roderigo!

RODERIGO

I do not find that thou dealest justly with me.

IAGO

What in the contrary?

RODERIGO

Every day thou daffest me with some device, Iago;and rather, as it seems to me now, keepest from meall conveniency than suppliest me with the leastadvantage of hope. I will indeed no longer endureit, nor am I yet persuaded to put up in peace whatalready I have foolishly suffered.

IAGO

Will you hear me, Roderigo?

RODERIGO

'Faith, I have heard too much, for your words andperformances are no kin together.

IAGO

You charge me most unjustly.

RODERIGO

With nought but truth. I have wasted myself out ofmy means. The jewels you have had from me todeliver to Desdemona would half have corrupted avotarist: you have told me she hath received themand returned me expectations and comforts of suddenrespect and acquaintance, but I find none.

IAGO

Well; go to; very well.

RODERIGO

Very well! go to! I cannot go to, man; nor 'tisnot very well: nay, I think it is scurvy, and beginto find myself fobbed in it.

IAGO

Very well.

RODERIGO

I tell you 'tis not very well. I will make myselfknown to Desdemona: if she will return me myjewels, I will give over my suit and repent myunlawful solicitation; if not, assure yourself Iwill seek satisfaction of you.

IAGO

You have said now.

RODERIGO

Ay, and said nothing but what I protest intendment of doing.

IAGO

Why, now I see there's mettle in thee, and even fromthis instant to build on thee a better opinion thanever before. Give me thy hand, Roderigo: thou hasttaken against me a most just exception; but yet, Iprotest, I have dealt most directly in thy affair.

RODERIGO

It hath not appeared.

IAGO

I grant indeed it hath not appeared, and yoursuspicion is not without wit and judgment. But,Roderigo, if thou hast that in thee indeed, which Ihave greater reason to believe now than ever, I meanpurpose, courage and valour, this night show it: ifthou the next night following enjoy not Desdemona,take me from this world with treachery and deviseengines for my life.

RODERIGO

Well, what is it? is it within reason and compass?

IAGO

Sir, there is especial commission come from Veniceto depute Cassio in Othello's place.

RODERIGO

Is that true? why, then Othello and Desdemonareturn again to Venice.

IAGO

O, no; he goes into Mauritania and takes away withhim the fair Desdemona, unless his abode belingered here by some accident: wherein none can beso determinate as the removing of Cassio.

RODERIGO

How do you mean, removing of him?

IAGO

Why, by making him uncapable of Othello's place;knocking out his brains.

RODERIGO

And that you would have me to do?

IAGO

Ay, if you dare do yourself a profit and a right.He sups to-night with a harlotry, and thither will Igo to him: he knows not yet of his horrorablefortune. If you will watch his going thence, whichI will fashion to fall out between twelve and one,you may take him at your pleasure: I will be nearto second your attempt, and he shall fall betweenus. Come, stand not amazed at it, but go along withme; I will show you such a necessity in his deaththat you shall think yourself bound to put it onhim. It is now high suppertime, and the night growsto waste: about it.

RODERIGO

I will hear further reason for this.

IAGO

And you shall be satisfied.Exeunt

SCENE III. Another room In the castle.

Enter OTHELLO, LODOVICO, DESDEMONA, EMILIA and Attendants


LODOVICO

I do beseech you, sir, trouble yourself no further.

OTHELLO

O, pardon me: 'twill do me good to walk.

LODOVICO

Madam, good night; I humbly thank your ladyship.

DESDEMONA

Your honour is most welcome.

OTHELLO

Will you walk, sir?O,--Desdemona,--

DESDEMONA

My lord?

OTHELLO

Get you to bed on the instant; I will be returnedforthwith: dismiss your attendant there: look it be done.

DESDEMONA

I will, my lord.Exeunt OTHELLO, LODOVICO, and Attendants


EMILIA

How goes it now? he looks gentler than he did.

DESDEMONA

He says he will return incontinent:He hath commanded me to go to bed,And bade me to dismiss you.

EMILIA

Dismiss me!

DESDEMONA

It was his bidding: therefore, good Emilia,.Give me my nightly wearing, and adieu:We must not now displease him.

EMILIA

I would you had never seen him!

DESDEMONA

So would not I	my love doth so approve him,That even his stubbornness, his cheques, his frowns--Prithee, unpin me,--have grace and favour in them.

EMILIA

I have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed.

DESDEMONA

All's one. Good faith, how foolish are our minds!If I do die before thee prithee, shroud meIn one of those same sheets.

EMILIA

Come, come you talk.

DESDEMONA

My mother had a maid call'd Barbara:She was in love, and he she loved proved madAnd did forsake her: she had a song of 'willow;'An old thing 'twas, but it express'd her fortune,And she died singing it: that song to-nightWill not go from my mind; I have much to do,But to go hang my head all at one side,And sing it like poor Barbara. Prithee, dispatch.

EMILIA

Shall I go fetch your night-gown?

DESDEMONA

No, unpin me here.This Lodovico is a proper man.

EMILIA

A very handsome man.

DESDEMONA

He speaks well.

EMILIA

I know a lady in Venice would have walked barefootto Palestine for a touch of his nether lip.

DESDEMONA

[Singing]  The poor soul sat sighing by a sycamore tree,Sing all a green willow:Her hand on her bosom, her head on her knee,Sing willow, willow, willow:The fresh streams ran by her, and murmur'd her moans;Sing willow, willow, willow;Her salt tears fell from her, and soften'd the stones;Lay by these:--Singing
Sing willow, willow, willow;Prithee, hie thee; he'll come anon:--Singing
Sing all a green willow must be my garland.Let nobody blame him; his scorn I approve,-Nay, that's not next.--Hark! who is't that knocks?

EMILIA

It's the wind.

DESDEMONA

[Singing]  I call'd my love false love; but whatsaid he then?Sing willow, willow, willow:If I court moe women, you'll couch with moe men!So, get thee gone; good night Ate eyes do itch;Doth that bode weeping?

EMILIA

'Tis neither here nor there.

DESDEMONA

I have heard it said so. O, these men, these men!Dost thou in conscience think,--tell me, Emilia,--That there be women do abuse their husbandsIn such gross kind?

EMILIA

There be some such, no question.

DESDEMONA

Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?

EMILIA

Why, would not you?

DESDEMONA

No, by this heavenly light!

EMILIA

Nor I neither by this heavenly light;I might do't as well i' the dark.

DESDEMONA

Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?

EMILIA

The world's a huge thing: it is a great price.For a small vice.

DESDEMONA

In troth, I think thou wouldst not.

EMILIA

In troth, I think I should; and undo't when I haddone. Marry, I would not do such a thing for ajoint-ring, nor for measures of lawn, nor forgowns, petticoats, nor caps, nor any pettyexhibition; but for the whole world,--why, who wouldnot make her husband a cuckold to make him amonarch? I should venture purgatory for't.

DESDEMONA

Beshrew me, if I would do such a wrongFor the whole world.

EMILIA

Why the wrong is but a wrong i' the world: andhaving the world for your labour, tis a wrong in yourown world, and you might quickly make it right.

DESDEMONA

I do not think there is any such woman.

EMILIA

Yes, a dozen; and as many to the vantage as wouldstore the world they played for.But I do think it is their husbands' faultsIf wives do fall: say that they slack their duties,And pour our treasures into foreign laps,Or else break out in peevish jealousies,Throwing restraint upon us; or say they strike us,Or scant our former having in despite;Why, we have galls, and though we have some grace,Yet have we some revenge. Let husbands knowTheir wives have sense like them: they see and smellAnd have their palates both for sweet and sour,As husbands have. What is it that they doWhen they change us for others? Is it sport?I think it is: and doth affection breed it?I think it doth: is't frailty that thus errs?It is so too: and have not we affections,Desires for sport, and frailty, as men have?Then let them use us well: else let them know,The ills we do, their ills instruct us so.

DESDEMONA

Good night, good night: heaven me such uses send,Not to pick bad from bad, but by bad mend!Exeunt

ACT V
SCENE I. Cyprus. A street.

Enter IAGO and RODERIGO


IAGO

Here, stand behind this bulk; straight will he come:Wear thy good rapier bare, and put it home:Quick, quick; fear nothing; I'll be at thy elbow:It makes us, or it mars us; think on that,And fix most firm thy resolution.

RODERIGO

Be near at hand; I may miscarry in't.

IAGO

Here, at thy hand: be bold, and take thy stand.Retires


RODERIGO

I have no great devotion to the deed;And yet he hath given me satisfying reasons:'Tis but a man gone. Forth, my sword: he dies.

IAGO

I have rubb'd this young quat almost to the sense,And he grows angry. Now, whether he kill Cassio,Or Cassio him, or each do kill the other,Every way makes my gain: live Roderigo,He calls me to a restitution largeOf gold and jewels that I bobb'd from him,As gifts to Desdemona;It must not be: if Cassio do remain,He hath a daily beauty in his lifeThat makes me ugly; and, besides, the MoorMay unfold me to him; there stand I in much peril:No, he must die. But so: I hear him coming.Enter CASSIO


RODERIGO

I know his gait, 'tis he.--Villain, thou diest!Makes a pass at CASSIO


CASSIO

That thrust had been mine enemy indeed,But that my coat is better than thou know'stI will make proof of thine.Draws, and wounds RODERIGO


RODERIGO

O, I am slain!IAGO from behind wounds CASSIO in the leg, and exit


CASSIO

I am maim'd for ever. Help, ho! murder! murder!Falls
Enter OTHELLO


OTHELLO

The voice of Cassio: Iago keeps his word.

RODERIGO

O, villain that I am!

OTHELLO

It is even so.

CASSIO

O, help, ho! light! a surgeon!

OTHELLO

'Tis he:--O brave Iago, honest and just,That hast such noble sense of thy friend's wrong!Thou teachest me. Minion, your dear lies dead,And your unblest fate hies: strumpet, I come.Forth of my heart those charms, thine eyes, are blotted;Thy bed, lust-stain'd, shall with lust's blood be spotted.Exit
Enter LODOVICO and GRATIANO


CASSIO

What, ho! no watch? no passage? murder! murder!

GRATIANO

'Tis some mischance; the cry is very direful.

CASSIO

O, help!

LODOVICO

Hark!

RODERIGO

O wretched villain!

LODOVICO

Two or three groan: it is a heavy night:These may be counterfeits: let's think't unsafeTo come in to the cry without more help.

RODERIGO

Nobody come? then shall I bleed to death.

LODOVICO

Hark!Re-enter IAGO, with a light


GRATIANO

Here's one comes in his shirt, with light and weapons.

IAGO

Who's there? whose noise is this that ones on murder?

LODOVICO

We do not know.

IAGO

                  Did not you hear a cry?

CASSIO

Here, here! for heaven's sake, help me!

IAGO

What's the matter?

GRATIANO

This is Othello's ancient, as I take it.

LODOVICO

The same indeed; a very valiant fellow.

IAGO

What are you here that cry so grievously?

CASSIO

Iago? O, I am spoil'd, undone by villains!Give me some help.

IAGO

O me, lieutenant! what villains have done this?

CASSIO

I think that one of them is hereabout,And cannot make away.

IAGO

O treacherous villains!What are you there? come in, and give some help.To LODOVICO and GRATIANO


RODERIGO

O, help me here!

CASSIO

That's one of them.

IAGO

O murderous slave! O villain!Stabs RODERIGO


RODERIGO

O damn'd Iago! O inhuman dog!

IAGO

Kill men i' the dark!--Where be these bloody thieves?--How silent is this town!--Ho! murder! murder!--What may you be? are you of good or evil?

LODOVICO

As you shall prove us, praise us.

IAGO

Signior Lodovico?

LODOVICO

He, sir.

IAGO

I cry you mercy. Here's Cassio hurt by villains.

GRATIANO

Cassio!

IAGO

How is't, brother!

CASSIO

My leg is cut in two.

IAGO

Marry, heaven forbid!Light, gentlemen; I'll bind it with my shirt.Enter BIANCA


BIANCA

What is the matter, ho? who is't that cried?

IAGO

Who is't that cried!

BIANCA

O my dear Cassio! my sweet Cassio! O Cassio,Cassio, Cassio!

IAGO

O notable strumpet! Cassio, may you suspectWho they should be that have thus many led you?

CASSIO

No.

GRATIANO

I am to find you thus: I have been to seek you.

IAGO

Lend me a garter. So. O, for a chair,To bear him easily hence!

BIANCA

Alas, he faints! O Cassio, Cassio, Cassio!

IAGO

Gentlemen all, I do suspect this trashTo be a party in this injury.Patience awhile, good Cassio. Come, come;Lend me a light. Know we this face or no?Alas my friend and my dear countrymanRoderigo! no:--yes, sure: O heaven! Roderigo.

GRATIANO

What, of Venice?

IAGO

Even he, sir; did you know him?

GRATIANO

Know him! ay.

IAGO

Signior Gratiano? I cry you gentle pardon;These bloody accidents must excuse my manners,That so neglected you.

GRATIANO

I am glad to see you.

IAGO

How do you, Cassio? O, a chair, a chair!

GRATIANO

Roderigo!

IAGO

He, he 'tis he.A chair brought in
O, that's well said; the chair!

GRATIANO

Some good man bear him carefully from hence;I'll fetch the general's surgeon.To BIANCA
For you, mistress,Save you your labour. He that lies slainhere, Cassio,Was my dear friend: what malice was between you?

CASSIO

None in the world; nor do I know the man.

IAGO

[To BIANCA]  What, look you pale? O, bear him outo' the air.CASSIO and RODERIGO are borne off
Stay you, good gentlemen. Look you pale, mistress?Do you perceive the gastness of her eye?Nay, if you stare, we shall hear more anon.Behold her well; I pray you, look upon her:Do you see, gentlemen? nay, guiltiness will speak,Though tongues were out of use.Enter EMILIA


EMILIA

'Las, what's the matter? what's the matter, husband?

IAGO

Cassio hath here been set on in the darkBy Roderigo and fellows that are scaped:He's almost slain, and Roderigo dead.

EMILIA

Alas, good gentleman! alas, good Cassio!

IAGO

This is the fruit of whoring. Prithee, Emilia,Go know of Cassio where he supp'd to-night.To BIANCA
What, do you shake at that?

BIANCA

He supp'd at my house; but I therefore shake not.

IAGO

O, did he so? I charge you, go with me.

EMILIA

Fie, fie upon thee, strumpet!

BIANCA

I am no strumpet; but of life as honestAs you that thus abuse me.

EMILIA

As I! foh! fie upon thee!

IAGO

Kind gentlemen, let's go see poor Cassio dress'd.Come, mistress, you must tell's another tale.Emilia run you to the citadel,And tell my lord and lady what hath happ'd.Will you go on? I pray.Aside
This is the nightThat either makes me or fordoes me quite.Exeunt

SCENE II. A bedchamber in the castle: DESDEMONA in bed asleep;

a light burning.Enter OTHELLO


OTHELLO

It is the cause, it is the cause, my soul,--Let me not name it to you, you chaste stars!--It is the cause. Yet I'll not shed her blood;Nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow,And smooth as monumental alabaster.Yet she must die, else she'll betray more men.Put out the light, and then put out the light:If I quench thee, thou flaming minister,I can again thy former light restore,Should I repent me: but once put out thy light,Thou cunning'st pattern of excelling nature,I know not where is that Promethean heatThat can thy light relume. When I have pluck'd the rose,I cannot give it vital growth again.It must needs wither: I'll smell it on the tree.Kissing her
Ah balmy breath, that dost almost persuadeJustice to break her sword! One more, one more.Be thus when thou art dead, and I will kill thee,And love thee after. One more, and this the last:So sweet was ne'er so fatal. I must weep,But they are cruel tears: this sorrow's heavenly;It strikes where it doth love. She wakes.

DESDEMONA

Who's there? Othello?

OTHELLO

Ay. Desdemona.

DESDEMONA

Will you come to bed, my lord?

OTHELLO

Have you pray'd to-night, Desdemona?

DESDEMONA

Ay, my lord.

OTHELLO

If you bethink yourself of any crimeUnreconciled as yet to heaven and grace,Solicit for it straight.

DESDEMONA

Alas, my lord, what do you mean by that?

OTHELLO

Well, do it, and be brief; I will walk by:I would not kill thy unprepared spirit;No; heaven forfend! I would not kill thy soul.

DESDEMONA

Talk you of killing?

OTHELLO

Ay, I do.

DESDEMONA

Then heavenHave mercy on me!

OTHELLO

                  Amen, with all my heart!

DESDEMONA

If you say so, I hope you will not kill me.

OTHELLO

Hum!

DESDEMONA

And yet I fear you; for you are fatal thenWhen your eyes roll so: why I should fear I know not,Since guiltiness I know not; but yet I feel I fear.

OTHELLO

Think on thy sins.

DESDEMONA

                  They are loves I bear to you.

OTHELLO

Ay, and for that thou diest.

DESDEMONA

That death's unnatural that kills for loving.Alas, why gnaw you so your nether lip?Some bloody passion shakes your very frame:These are portents; but yet I hope, I hope,They do not point on me.

OTHELLO

Peace, and be still!

DESDEMONA

I will so. What's the matter?

OTHELLO

That handkerchief which I so loved and gave theeThou gavest to Cassio.

DESDEMONA

No, by my life and soul!Send for the man, and ask him.

OTHELLO

Sweet soul, take heed,Take heed of perjury; thou art on thy deathbed.

DESDEMONA

Ay, but not yet to die.

OTHELLO

Yes, presently:Therefore confess thee freely of thy sin;For to deny each article with oathCannot remove nor choke the strong conceptionThat I do groan withal. Thou art to die.

DESDEMONA

Then Lord have mercy on me!

OTHELLO

I say, amen.

DESDEMONA

And have you mercy too! I never didOffend you in my life; never loved CassioBut with such general warranty of heavenAs I might love: I never gave him token.

OTHELLO

By heaven, I saw my handkerchief in's hand.O perjured woman! thou dost stone my heart,And makest me call what I intend to doA murder, which I thought a sacrifice:I saw the handkerchief.

DESDEMONA

He found it then;I never gave it him: send for him hither;Let him confess a truth.

OTHELLO

He hath confess'd.

DESDEMONA

What, my lord?

OTHELLO

That he hath used thee.

DESDEMONA

How? unlawfully?

OTHELLO

Ay.

DESDEMONA

He will not say so.

OTHELLO

No, his mouth is stopp'd;Honest Iago hath ta'en order for't.

DESDEMONA

O! my fear interprets: what, is he dead?

OTHELLO

Had all his hairs been lives, my great revengeHad stomach for them all.

DESDEMONA

Alas! he is betray'd and I undone.

OTHELLO

Out, strumpet! weep'st thou for him to my face?

DESDEMONA

O, banish me, my lord, but kill me not!

OTHELLO

Down, strumpet!

DESDEMONA

Kill me to-morrow: let me live to-night!

OTHELLO

Nay, if you strive--

DESDEMONA

But half an hour!

OTHELLO

                  Being done, there is no pause.

DESDEMONA

But while I say one prayer!

OTHELLO

It is too late.He stifles her


EMILIA

[Within]  My lord , my lord! what, ho! my lord, my lord!

OTHELLO

What noise is this? Not dead? not yet quite dead?I that am cruel am yet merciful;I would not have thee linger in thy pain: So, so.

EMILIA

[Within]  What, ho! my lord, my lord!

OTHELLO

Who's there?

EMILIA

[Within]  O, good my lord, I would speak a word with you!

OTHELLO

Yes: 'tis Emilia. By and by. She's dead.'Tis like she comes to speak of Cassio's death.--The noise was here. Ha! no more moving?Still as the grave. Shall she come in? were't good?--I think she stirs again:--no. What's best to do?If she come in, she'll sure speak to my wife:My wife! my wife! what wife? I have no wife.O insupportable! O heavy hour!Methinks it should be now a huge eclipseOf sun and moon, and that the affrighted globeShould yawn at alteration.

EMILIA

[Within]  I do beseech youThat I may speak with you, O, good my lord!

OTHELLO

I had forgot thee: O, come in, Emilia;Soft; by and by. Let me the curtains draw.Where art thou?Unlocks the door
Enter EMILIA
What's the matter with thee now?

EMILIA

O, my good lord, yonder's foul murders done!

OTHELLO

What, now?

EMILIA

But now, my lord.

OTHELLO

It is the very error of the moon;She comes more nearer earth than she was wont,And makes men mad.

EMILIA

Cassio, my lord, hath kill'd a young VenetianCall'd Roderigo.

OTHELLO

                  Roderigo kill'd!And Cassio kill'd!

EMILIA

No, Cassio is not kill'd.

OTHELLO

Not Cassio kill'd! then murder's out of tune,And sweet revenge grows harsh.

DESDEMONA

O, falsely, falsely murder'd!

EMILIA

Alas, what cry is that?

OTHELLO

That! what?

EMILIA

Out, and alas! that was my lady's voice.Help! help, ho! help! O lady, speak again!Sweet Desdemona! O sweet mistress, speak!

DESDEMONA

A guiltless death I die.

EMILIA

O, who hath done this deed?

DESDEMONA

Nobody; I myself. FarewellCommend me to my kind lord: O, farewell!Dies


OTHELLO

Why, how should she be murder'd?

EMILIA

Alas, who knows?

OTHELLO

You heard her say herself, it was not I.

EMILIA

She said so: I must needs report the truth.

OTHELLO

She's, like a liar, gone to burning hell:'Twas I that kill'd her.

EMILIA

O, the more angel she,And you the blacker devil!

OTHELLO

She turn'd to folly, and she was a whore.

EMILIA

Thou dost belie her, and thou art a devil.

OTHELLO

She was false as water.

EMILIA

Thou art rash as fire, to sayThat she was false: O, she was heavenly true!

OTHELLO

Cassio did top her; ask thy husband else.O, I were damn'd beneath all depth in hell,But that I did proceed upon just groundsTo this extremity. Thy husband knew it all.

EMILIA

My husband!

OTHELLO

Thy husband.

EMILIA

That she was false to wedlock?

OTHELLO

Ay, with Cassio. Nay, had she been true,If heaven would make me such another worldOf one entire and Perfect chrysolite,I'ld not have sold her for it.

EMILIA

My husband!

OTHELLO

          Ay, 'twas he that told me first:An honest man he is, and hates the slimeThat sticks on filthy deeds.

EMILIA

My husband!

OTHELLO

What needs this iteration, woman? I say thy husband.

EMILIA

O mistress, villany hath made mocks with love,My husband say that she was false!

OTHELLO

He, woman;I say thy husband: dost understand the word?My friend, thy husband, honest, honest Iago.

EMILIA

If he say so, may his pernicious soulRot half a grain a day! he lies to the heart:She was too fond of her most filthy bargain.

OTHELLO

Ha!

EMILIA

Do thy worst:This deed of thine is no more worthy heavenThan thou wast worthy her.

OTHELLO

Peace, you were best.

EMILIA

Thou hast not half that power to do me harmAs I have to be hurt. O gull! O dolt!As ignorant as dirt! thou hast done a deed--I care not for thy sword; I'll make thee known,Though I lost twenty lives.--Help! help, ho! help!The Moor hath kill'd my mistress! Murder! murder!Enter MONTANO, GRATIANO, IAGO, and others


MONTANO

What is the matter? How now, general!

EMILIA

O, are you come, Iago? you have done well,That men must lay their murders on your neck.

GRATIANO

What is the matter?

EMILIA

Disprove this villain, if thou be'st a man:He says thou told'st him that his wife was false:I know thou didst not, thou'rt not such a villain:Speak, for my heart is full.

IAGO

I told him what I thought, and told no moreThan what he found himself was apt and true.

EMILIA

But did you ever tell him she was false?

IAGO

I did.

EMILIA

You told a lie, an odious, damned lie;Upon my soul, a lie, a wicked lie.She false with Cassio!--did you say with Cassio?

IAGO

With Cassio, mistress. Go to, charm your tongue.

EMILIA

I will not charm my tongue; I am bound to speak:My mistress here lies murder'd in her bed,--

All

O heavens forfend!

EMILIA

And your reports have set the murder on.

OTHELLO

Nay, stare not, masters: it is true, indeed.

GRATIANO

'Tis a strange truth.

MONTANO

O monstrous act!

EMILIA

                  Villany, villany, villany!I think upon't, I think: I smell't: O villany!--I thought so then:--I'll kill myself for grief:--O villany, villany!

IAGO

What, are you mad? I charge you, get you home.

EMILIA

Good gentlemen, let me have leave to speak:'Tis proper I obey him, but not now.Perchance, Iago, I will ne'er go home.

OTHELLO

O! O! O!He falls on the bed


EMILIA

       Nay, lay thee down and roar;For thou hast kill'd the sweetest innocentThat e'er did lift up eye.

OTHELLO

[Rising]  O, she was foul!I scarce did know you, uncle: there lies your niece,Whose breath, indeed, these hands have newly stopp'd:I know this act shows horrible and grim.

GRATIANO

Poor Desdemona! I am glad thy father's dead:Thy match was mortal to him, and pure griefShore his old thread in twain: did he live now,This sight would make him do a desperate turn,Yea, curse his better angel from his side,And fall to reprobation.

OTHELLO

'Tis pitiful; but yet Iago knowsThat she with Cassio hath the act of shameA thousand times committed; Cassio confess'd it:And she did gratify his amorous worksWith that recognizance and pledge of loveWhich I first gave her; I saw it in his hand:It was a handkerchief, an antique tokenMy father gave my mother.

EMILIA

O heaven! O heavenly powers!

IAGO

Come, hold your peace.

EMILIA

'Twill out, 'twill out: I peace!No, I will speak as liberal as the north:Let heaven and men and devils, let them all,All, all, cry shame against me, yet I'll speak.

IAGO

Be wise, and get you home.

EMILIA

I will not.IAGO offers to stab EMILIA


GRATIANO

Fie!Your sword upon a woman?

EMILIA

O thou dull Moor! that handkerchief thou speak'st ofI found by fortune and did give my husband;For often, with a solemn earnestness,More than indeed belong'd to such a trifle,He begg'd of me to steal it.

IAGO

Villanous whore!

EMILIA

She give it Cassio! no, alas! I found it,And I did give't my husband.

IAGO

Filth, thou liest!

EMILIA

By heaven, I do not, I do not, gentlemen.O murderous coxcomb! what should such a foolDo with so good a woman?

OTHELLO

Are there no stones in heavenBut what serve for the thunder?--Precious villain!He runs at IAGO  IAGO, from behind, stabs EMILIA, and exit


GRATIANO

The woman falls; sure, he hath kill'd his wife.

EMILIA

Ay, ay: O, lay me by my mistress' side.

GRATIANO

He's gone, but his wife's kill'd.

MONTANO

'Tis a notorious villain. Take you this weapon,Which I have here recover'd from the Moor:Come, guard the door without; let him not pass,But kill him rather. I'll after that same villain,For 'tis a damned slave.Exeunt MONTANO and GRATIANO


OTHELLO

I am not valiant neither,But ever puny whipster gets my sword:But why should honour outlive honesty?Let it go all.

EMILIA

What did thy song bode, lady?Hark, canst thou hear me? I will play the swan.And die in music.Singing
Willow, willow, willow,--Moor, she was chaste; she loved thee, cruel Moor;So come my soul to bliss, as I speak true;So speaking as I think, I die, I die.Dies


OTHELLO

I have another weapon in this chamber;It is a sword of Spain, the ice-brook's temper:--O, here it is. Uncle, I must come forth.

GRATIANO

[Within]  If thou attempt it, it will cost thee dear:Thou hast no weapon, and perforce must suffer.

OTHELLO

Look in upon me then and speak with me,Or, naked as I am, I will assault thee.Re-enter GRATIANO


GRATIANO

What is the matter?

OTHELLO

Behold, I have a weapon;A better never did itself sustainUpon a soldier's thigh: I have seen the day,That, with this little arm and this good sword,I have made my way through more impedimentsThan twenty times your stop: but, O vain boast!Who can control his fate? 'tis not so now.Be not afraid, though you do see me weapon'd;Here is my journey's end, here is my butt,And very sea-mark of my utmost sail.Do you go back dismay'd? 'tis a lost fear;Man but a rush against Othello's breast,And he retires. Where should Othello go?Now, how dost thou look now? O ill-starr'd wench!Pale as thy smock! when we shall meet at compt,This look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven,And fiends will snatch at it. Cold, cold, my girl!Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave!Whip me, ye devils,From the possession of this heavenly sight!Blow me about in winds! roast me in sulphur!Wash me in steep-down gulfs of liquid fire!O Desdemona! Desdemona! dead!Oh! Oh! Oh!Enter LODOVICO. MONTANO, CASSIO carried in a chair, and Officers with IAGO, prisoner


LODOVICO

Where is this rash and most unfortunate man?

OTHELLO

That's he that was Othello: here I am.

LODOVICO

Where is that viper? bring the villain forth.

OTHELLO

I look down towards his feet; but that's a fable.If that thou best a devil, I cannot kill thee.Wounds IAGO


LODOVICO

Wrench his sword from him.

IAGO

I bleed, sir; but not kill'd.

OTHELLO

I am not sorry neither: I'ld have thee live;For, in my sense, 'tis happiness to die.

LODOVICO

O thou Othello, thou wert once so good,Fall'n in the practise of a damned slave,What shall be said to thee?

OTHELLO

Why, any thing:An honourable murderer, if you will;For nought I did in hate, but all in honour.

LODOVICO

This wretch hath part confess'd his villany:Did you and he consent in Cassio's death?

OTHELLO

Ay.

CASSIO

Dear general, I never gave you cause.

OTHELLO

I do believe it, and I ask your pardon.Will you, I pray, demand that demi-devilWhy he hath thus ensnared my soul and body?

IAGO

Demand me nothing: what you know, you know:From this time forth I never will speak word.

LODOVICO

What, not to pray?

GRATIANO

                  Torments will ope your lips.

OTHELLO

Well, thou dost best.

LODOVICO

Sir, you shall understand what hath befall'n,Which, as I think, you know not. Here is a letterFound in the pocket of the slain Roderigo;And here another: the one of them importsThe death of Cassio to be undertookBy Roderigo.

OTHELLO

O villain!

CASSIO

Most heathenish and most gross!

LODOVICO

Now here's another discontented paper,Found in his pocket too; and this, it seems,Roderigo meant to have sent this damned villain;But that belike Iago in the interimCame in and satisfied him.

OTHELLO

O the pernicious caitiff!How came you, Cassio, by that handkerchiefThat was my wife's?

CASSIO

I found it in my chamber:And he himself confess'd but even nowThat there he dropp'd it for a special purposeWhich wrought to his desire.

OTHELLO

O fool! fool! fool!

CASSIO

There is besides in Roderigo's letter,How he upbraids Iago, that he made himBrave me upon the watch; whereon it cameThat I was cast: and even but now he spake,After long seeming dead, Iago hurt him,Iago set him on.

LODOVICO

You must forsake this room, and go with us:Your power and your command is taken off,And Cassio rules in Cyprus. For this slave,If there be any cunning crueltyThat can torment him much and hold him long,It shall be his. You shall close prisoner rest,Till that the nature of your fault be knownTo the Venetian state. Come, bring him away.

OTHELLO

Soft you; a word or two before you go.I have done the state some service, and they know't.No more of that. I pray you, in your letters,When you shall these unlucky deeds relate,Speak of me as I am; nothing extenuate,Nor set down aught in malice: then must you speakOf one that loved not wisely but too well;Of one not easily jealous, but being wroughtPerplex'd in the extreme; of one whose hand,Like the base Indian, threw a pearl awayRicher than all his tribe; of one whose subdued eyes,Albeit unused to the melting mood,Drop tears as fast as the Arabian treesTheir medicinal gum. Set you down this;And say besides, that in Aleppo once,Where a malignant and a turban'd TurkBeat a Venetian and traduced the state,I took by the throat the circumcised dog,And smote him, thus.Stabs himself


LODOVICO

O bloody period!

GRATIANO

                  All that's spoke is marr'd.

OTHELLO

I kiss'd thee ere I kill'd thee: no way but this;Killing myself, to die upon a kiss.Falls on the bed, and dies


CASSIO

This did I fear, but thought he had no weapon;For he was great of heart.

LODOVICO

[To IAGO]  O Spartan dog,More fell than anguish, hunger, or the sea!Look on the tragic loading of this bed;This is thy work: the object poisons sight;Let it be hid. Gratiano, keep the house,And seize upon the fortunes of the Moor,For they succeed on you. To you, lord governor,Remains the censure of this hellish villain;The time, the place, the torture: O, enforce it!Myself will straight aboard: and to the stateThis heavy act with heavy heart relate.Exeunt
