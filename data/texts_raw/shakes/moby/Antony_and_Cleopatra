ACT I
SCENE I. Alexandria. A room in CLEOPATRA's palace.

Enter DEMETRIUS and PHILO


PHILO

Nay, but this dotage of our general'sO'erflows the measure: those his goodly eyes,That o'er the files and musters of the warHave glow'd like plated Mars, now bend, now turn,The office and devotion of their viewUpon a tawny front: his captain's heart,Which in the scuffles of great fights hath burstThe buckles on his breast, reneges all temper,And is become the bellows and the fanTo cool a gipsy's lust.Flourish. Enter ANTONY, CLEOPATRA, her Ladies, the Train, with Eunuchs fanning her
Look, where they come:Take but good note, and you shall see in him.The triple pillar of the world transform'dInto a strumpet's fool: behold and see.

CLEOPATRA

If it be love indeed, tell me how much.

MARK ANTONY

There's beggary in the love that can be reckon'd.

CLEOPATRA

I'll set a bourn how far to be beloved.

MARK ANTONY

Then must thou needs find out new heaven, new earth.Enter an Attendant


Attendant

News, my good lord, from Rome.

MARK ANTONY

Grates me: the sum.

CLEOPATRA

Nay, hear them, Antony:Fulvia perchance is angry; or, who knowsIf the scarce-bearded Caesar have not sentHis powerful mandate to you, 'Do this, or this;Take in that kingdom, and enfranchise that;Perform 't, or else we damn thee.'

MARK ANTONY

How, my love!

CLEOPATRA

Perchance! nay, and most like:You must not stay here longer, your dismissionIs come from Caesar; therefore hear it, Antony.Where's Fulvia's process? Caesar's I would say? both?Call in the messengers. As I am Egypt's queen,Thou blushest, Antony; and that blood of thineIs Caesar's homager: else so thy cheek pays shameWhen shrill-tongued Fulvia scolds. The messengers!

MARK ANTONY

Let Rome in Tiber melt, and the wide archOf the ranged empire fall! Here is my space.Kingdoms are clay: our dungy earth alikeFeeds beast as man: the nobleness of lifeIs to do thus; when such a mutual pairEmbracing
And such a twain can do't, in which I bind,On pain of punishment, the world to weetWe stand up peerless.

CLEOPATRA

Excellent falsehood!Why did he marry Fulvia, and not love her?I'll seem the fool I am not; AntonyWill be himself.

MARK ANTONY

                  But stirr'd by Cleopatra.Now, for the love of Love and her soft hours,Let's not confound the time with conference harsh:There's not a minute of our lives should stretchWithout some pleasure now. What sport tonight?

CLEOPATRA

Hear the ambassadors.

MARK ANTONY

Fie, wrangling queen!Whom every thing becomes, to chide, to laugh,To weep; whose every passion fully strivesTo make itself, in thee, fair and admired!No messenger, but thine; and all aloneTo-night we'll wander through the streets and noteThe qualities of people. Come, my queen;Last night you did desire it: speak not to us.Exeunt MARK ANTONY and CLEOPATRA with their train


DEMETRIUS

Is Caesar with Antonius prized so slight?

PHILO

Sir, sometimes, when he is not Antony,He comes too short of that great propertyWhich still should go with Antony.

DEMETRIUS

I am full sorryThat he approves the common liar, whoThus speaks of him at Rome: but I will hopeOf better deeds to-morrow. Rest you happy!Exeunt

SCENE II. The same. Another room.

Enter CHARMIAN, IRAS, ALEXAS, and a Soothsayer


CHARMIAN

Lord Alexas, sweet Alexas, most any thing Alexas,almost most absolute Alexas, where's the soothsayerthat you praised so to the queen? O, that I knewthis husband, which, you say, must charge his hornswith garlands!

ALEXAS

Soothsayer!

Soothsayer

Your will?

CHARMIAN

Is this the man? Is't you, sir, that know things?

Soothsayer

In nature's infinite book of secrecyA little I can read.

ALEXAS

Show him your hand.Enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS


DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

Bring in the banquet quickly; wine enoughCleopatra's health to drink.

CHARMIAN

Good sir, give me good fortune.

Soothsayer

I make not, but foresee.

CHARMIAN

Pray, then, foresee me one.

Soothsayer

You shall be yet far fairer than you are.

CHARMIAN

He means in flesh.

IRAS

No, you shall paint when you are old.

CHARMIAN

Wrinkles forbid!

ALEXAS

Vex not his prescience; be attentive.

CHARMIAN

Hush!

Soothsayer

You shall be more beloving than beloved.

CHARMIAN

I had rather heat my liver with drinking.

ALEXAS

Nay, hear him.

CHARMIAN

Good now, some excellent fortune! Let me be marriedto three kings in a forenoon, and widow them all:let me have a child at fifty, to whom Herod of Jewrymay do homage: find me to marry me with OctaviusCaesar, and companion me with my mistress.

Soothsayer

You shall outlive the lady whom you serve.

CHARMIAN

O excellent! I love long life better than figs.

Soothsayer

You have seen and proved a fairer former fortuneThan that which is to approach.

CHARMIAN

Then belike my children shall have no names:prithee, how many boys and wenches must I have?

Soothsayer

If every of your wishes had a womb.And fertile every wish, a million.

CHARMIAN

Out, fool! I forgive thee for a witch.

ALEXAS

You think none but your sheets are privy to your wishes.

CHARMIAN

Nay, come, tell Iras hers.

ALEXAS

We'll know all our fortunes.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

Mine, and most of our fortunes, to-night, shallbe--drunk to bed.

IRAS

There's a palm presages chastity, if nothing else.

CHARMIAN

E'en as the o'erflowing Nilus presageth famine.

IRAS

Go, you wild bedfellow, you cannot soothsay.

CHARMIAN

Nay, if an oily palm be not a fruitfulprognostication, I cannot scratch mine ear. Prithee,tell her but a worky-day fortune.

Soothsayer

Your fortunes are alike.

IRAS

But how, but how? give me particulars.

Soothsayer

I have said.

IRAS

Am I not an inch of fortune better than she?

CHARMIAN

Well, if you were but an inch of fortune better thanI, where would you choose it?

IRAS

Not in my husband's nose.

CHARMIAN

Our worser thoughts heavens mend! Alexas,--come,his fortune, his fortune! O, let him marry a womanthat cannot go, sweet Isis, I beseech thee! and lether die too, and give him a worse! and let worstfollow worse, till the worst of all follow himlaughing to his grave, fifty-fold a cuckold! GoodIsis, hear me this prayer, though thou deny me amatter of more weight; good Isis, I beseech thee!

IRAS

Amen. Dear goddess, hear that prayer of the people!for, as it is a heartbreaking to see a handsome manloose-wived, so it is a deadly sorrow to behold afoul knave uncuckolded: therefore, dear Isis, keepdecorum, and fortune him accordingly!

CHARMIAN

Amen.

ALEXAS

Lo, now, if it lay in their hands to make me acuckold, they would make themselves whores, butthey'ld do't!

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

Hush! here comes Antony.

CHARMIAN

Not he; the queen.Enter CLEOPATRA


CLEOPATRA

Saw you my lord?

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

                  No, lady.

CLEOPATRA

Was he not here?

CHARMIAN

No, madam.

CLEOPATRA

He was disposed to mirth; but on the suddenA Roman thought hath struck him. Enobarbus!

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

Madam?

CLEOPATRA

Seek him, and bring him hither.Where's Alexas?

ALEXAS

Here, at your service. My lord approaches.

CLEOPATRA

We will not look upon him: go with us.Exeunt
Enter MARK ANTONY with a Messenger and Attendants


Messenger

Fulvia thy wife first came into the field.

MARK ANTONY

Against my brother Lucius?

Messenger

Ay:But soon that war had end, and the time's stateMade friends of them, joining their force 'gainst Caesar;Whose better issue in the war, from Italy,Upon the first encounter, drave them.

MARK ANTONY

Well, what worst?

Messenger

The nature of bad news infects the teller.

MARK ANTONY

When it concerns the fool or coward. On:Things that are past are done with me. 'Tis thus:Who tells me true, though in his tale lie death,I hear him as he flatter'd.

Messenger

Labienus--This is stiff news--hath, with his Parthian force,Extended Asia from Euphrates;His conquering banner shook from SyriaTo Lydia and to Ionia; Whilst--

MARK ANTONY

Antony, thou wouldst say,--

Messenger

O, my lord!

MARK ANTONY

Speak to me home, mince not the general tongue:Name Cleopatra as she is call'd in Rome;Rail thou in Fulvia's phrase; and taunt my faultsWith such full licence as both truth and maliceHave power to utter. O, then we bring forth weeds,When our quick minds lie still; and our ills told usIs as our earing. Fare thee well awhile.

Messenger

At your noble pleasure.Exit


MARK ANTONY

From Sicyon, ho, the news! Speak there!

First Attendant

The man from Sicyon,--is there such an one?

Second Attendant

He stays upon your will.

MARK ANTONY

Let him appear.These strong Egyptian fetters I must break,Or lose myself in dotage.Enter another Messenger
What are you?

Second Messenger

Fulvia thy wife is dead.

MARK ANTONY

Where died she?

Second Messenger

In Sicyon:Her length of sickness, with what else more seriousImporteth thee to know, this bears.Gives a letter


MARK ANTONY

Forbear me.Exit Second Messenger
There's a great spirit gone! Thus did I desire it:What our contempt doth often hurl from us,We wish it ours again; the present pleasure,By revolution lowering, does becomeThe opposite of itself: she's good, being gone;The hand could pluck her back that shoved her on.I must from this enchanting queen break off:Ten thousand harms, more than the ills I know,My idleness doth hatch. How now! Enobarbus!Re-enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS


DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

What's your pleasure, sir?

MARK ANTONY

I must with haste from hence.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

Why, then, we kill all our women:we see how mortal an unkindness is to them;if they suffer our departure, death's the word.

MARK ANTONY

I must be gone.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

Under a compelling occasion, let women die; it werepity to cast them away for nothing; though, betweenthem and a great cause, they should be esteemednothing. Cleopatra, catching but the least noise ofthis, dies instantly; I have seen her die twentytimes upon far poorer moment: I do think there ismettle in death, which commits some loving act uponher, she hath such a celerity in dying.

MARK ANTONY

She is cunning past man's thought.Exit ALEXAS


DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

Alack, sir, no; her passions are made of nothing butthe finest part of pure love: we cannot call herwinds and waters sighs and tears; they are greaterstorms and tempests than almanacs can report: thiscannot be cunning in her; if it be, she makes ashower of rain as well as Jove.

MARK ANTONY

Would I had never seen her.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

O, sir, you had then left unseen a wonderful pieceof work; which not to have been blest withal wouldhave discredited your travel.

MARK ANTONY

Fulvia is dead.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

Sir?

MARK ANTONY

Fulvia is dead.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

Fulvia!

MARK ANTONY

Dead.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

Why, sir, give the gods a thankful sacrifice. Whenit pleaseth their deities to take the wife of a manfrom him, it shows to man the tailors of the earth;comforting therein, that when old robes are wornout, there are members to make new. If there wereno more women but Fulvia, then had you indeed a cut,and the case to be lamented: this grief is crownedwith consolation; your old smock brings forth a newpetticoat: and indeed the tears live in an onionthat should water this sorrow.

MARK ANTONY

The business she hath broached in the stateCannot endure my absence.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

And the business you have broached here cannot bewithout you; especially that of Cleopatra's, whichwholly depends on your abode.

MARK ANTONY

No more light answers. Let our officersHave notice what we purpose. I shall breakThe cause of our expedience to the queen,And get her leave to part. For not aloneThe death of Fulvia, with more urgent touches,Do strongly speak to us; but the letters tooOf many our contriving friends in RomePetition us at home: Sextus PompeiusHath given the dare to Caesar, and commandsThe empire of the sea: our slippery people,Whose love is never link'd to the deserverTill his deserts are past, begin to throwPompey the Great and all his dignitiesUpon his son; who, high in name and power,Higher than both in blood and life, stands upFor the main soldier: whose quality, going on,The sides o' the world may danger: much is breeding,Which, like the courser's hair, hath yet but life,And not a serpent's poison. Say, our pleasure,To such whose place is under us, requiresOur quick remove from hence.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

I shall do't.Exeunt

SCENE III. The same. Another room.

Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and ALEXAS


CLEOPATRA

Where is he?

CHARMIAN

                  I did not see him since.

CLEOPATRA

See where he is, who's with him, what he does:I did not send you: if you find him sad,Say I am dancing; if in mirth, reportThat I am sudden sick: quick, and return.Exit ALEXAS


CHARMIAN

Madam, methinks, if you did love him dearly,You do not hold the method to enforceThe like from him.

CLEOPATRA

                  What should I do, I do not?

CHARMIAN

In each thing give him way, cross him nothing.

CLEOPATRA

Thou teachest like a fool; the way to lose him.

CHARMIAN

Tempt him not so too far; I wish, forbear:In time we hate that which we often fear.But here comes Antony.Enter MARK ANTONY


CLEOPATRA

I am sick and sullen.

MARK ANTONY

I am sorry to give breathing to my purpose,--

CLEOPATRA

Help me away, dear Charmian; I shall fall:It cannot be thus long, the sides of natureWill not sustain it.

MARK ANTONY

Now, my dearest queen,--

CLEOPATRA

Pray you, stand further from me.

MARK ANTONY

What's the matter?

CLEOPATRA

I know, by that same eye, there's some good news.What says the married woman? You may go:Would she had never given you leave to come!Let her not say 'tis I that keep you here:I have no power upon you; hers you are.

MARK ANTONY

The gods best know,--

CLEOPATRA

O, never was there queenSo mightily betray'd! yet at the firstI saw the treasons planted.

MARK ANTONY

Cleopatra,--

CLEOPATRA

Why should I think you can be mine and true,Though you in swearing shake the throned gods,Who have been false to Fulvia? Riotous madness,To be entangled with those mouth-made vows,Which break themselves in swearing!

MARK ANTONY

Most sweet queen,--

CLEOPATRA

Nay, pray you, seek no colour for your going,But bid farewell, and go: when you sued staying,Then was the time for words: no going then;Eternity was in our lips and eyes,Bliss in our brows' bent; none our parts so poor,But was a race of heaven: they are so still,Or thou, the greatest soldier of the world,Art turn'd the greatest liar.

MARK ANTONY

How now, lady!

CLEOPATRA

I would I had thy inches; thou shouldst knowThere were a heart in Egypt.

MARK ANTONY

Hear me, queen:The strong necessity of time commandsOur services awhile; but my full heartRemains in use with you. Our ItalyShines o'er with civil swords: Sextus PompeiusMakes his approaches to the port of Rome:Equality of two domestic powersBreed scrupulous faction: the hated, grown to strength,Are newly grown to love: the condemn'd Pompey,Rich in his father's honour, creeps apace,Into the hearts of such as have not thrivedUpon the present state, whose numbers threaten;And quietness, grown sick of rest, would purgeBy any desperate change: my more particular,And that which most with you should safe my going,Is Fulvia's death.

CLEOPATRA

Though age from folly could not give me freedom,It does from childishness: can Fulvia die?

MARK ANTONY

She's dead, my queen:Look here, and at thy sovereign leisure readThe garboils she awaked; at the last, best:See when and where she died.

CLEOPATRA

O most false love!Where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fillWith sorrowful water? Now I see, I see,In Fulvia's death, how mine received shall be.

MARK ANTONY

Quarrel no more, but be prepared to knowThe purposes I bear; which are, or cease,As you shall give the advice. By the fireThat quickens Nilus' slime, I go from henceThy soldier, servant; making peace or warAs thou affect'st.

CLEOPATRA

                  Cut my lace, Charmian, come;But let it be: I am quickly ill, and well,So Antony loves.

MARK ANTONY

                  My precious queen, forbear;And give true evidence to his love, which standsAn honourable trial.

CLEOPATRA

So Fulvia told me.I prithee, turn aside and weep for her,Then bid adieu to me, and say the tearsBelong to Egypt: good now, play one sceneOf excellent dissembling; and let it lookLife perfect honour.

MARK ANTONY

You'll heat my blood: no more.

CLEOPATRA

You can do better yet; but this is meetly.

MARK ANTONY

Now, by my sword,--

CLEOPATRA

And target. Still he mends;But this is not the best. Look, prithee, Charmian,How this Herculean Roman does becomeThe carriage of his chafe.

MARK ANTONY

I'll leave you, lady.

CLEOPATRA

Courteous lord, one word.Sir, you and I must part, but that's not it:Sir, you and I have loved, but there's not it;That you know well: something it is I would,O, my oblivion is a very Antony,And I am all forgotten.

MARK ANTONY

But that your royaltyHolds idleness your subject, I should take youFor idleness itself.

CLEOPATRA

'Tis sweating labourTo bear such idleness so near the heartAs Cleopatra this. But, sir, forgive me;Since my becomings kill me, when they do notEye well to you: your honour calls you hence;Therefore be deaf to my unpitied folly.And all the gods go with you! upon your swordSit laurel victory! and smooth successBe strew'd before your feet!

MARK ANTONY

Let us go. Come;Our separation so abides, and flies,That thou, residing here, go'st yet with me,And I, hence fleeting, here remain with thee. Away!Exeunt

SCENE IV. Rome. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's house.

Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, reading a letter, LEPIDUS, and their Train


OCTAVIUS CAESAR

You may see, Lepidus, and henceforth know,It is not Caesar's natural vice to hateOur great competitor: from AlexandriaThis is the news: he fishes, drinks, and wastesThe lamps of night in revel; is not more man-likeThan Cleopatra; nor the queen of PtolemyMore womanly than he; hardly gave audience, orVouchsafed to think he had partners: you shall find thereA man who is the abstract of all faultsThat all men follow.

LEPIDUS

I must not think there areEvils enow to darken all his goodness:His faults in him seem as the spots of heaven,More fiery by night's blackness; hereditary,Rather than purchased; what he cannot change,Than what he chooses.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

You are too indulgent. Let us grant, it is notAmiss to tumble on the bed of Ptolemy;To give a kingdom for a mirth; to sitAnd keep the turn of tippling with a slave;To reel the streets at noon, and stand the buffetWith knaves that smell of sweat: say thisbecomes him,--As his composure must be rare indeedWhom these things cannot blemish,--yet must AntonyNo way excuse his soils, when we do bearSo great weight in his lightness. If he fill'dHis vacancy with his voluptuousness,Full surfeits, and the dryness of his bones,Call on him for't: but to confound such time,That drums him from his sport, and speaks as loudAs his own state and ours,--'tis to be chidAs we rate boys, who, being mature in knowledge,Pawn their experience to their present pleasure,And so rebel to judgment.Enter a Messenger


LEPIDUS

Here's more news.

Messenger

Thy biddings have been done; and every hour,Most noble Caesar, shalt thou have reportHow 'tis abroad. Pompey is strong at sea;And it appears he is beloved of thoseThat only have fear'd Caesar: to the portsThe discontents repair, and men's reportsGive him much wrong'd.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

I should have known no less.It hath been taught us from the primal state,That he which is was wish'd until he were;And the ebb'd man, ne'er loved till ne'er worth love,Comes dear'd by being lack'd. This common body,Like to a vagabond flag upon the stream,Goes to and back, lackeying the varying tide,To rot itself with motion.

Messenger

Caesar, I bring thee word,Menecrates and Menas, famous pirates,Make the sea serve them, which they ear and woundWith keels of every kind: many hot inroadsThey make in Italy; the borders maritimeLack blood to think on't, and flush youth revolt:No vessel can peep forth, but 'tis as soonTaken as seen; for Pompey's name strikes moreThan could his war resisted.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

Antony,Leave thy lascivious wassails. When thou onceWast beaten from Modena, where thou slew'stHirtius and Pansa, consuls, at thy heelDid famine follow; whom thou fought'st against,Though daintily brought up, with patience moreThan savages could suffer: thou didst drinkThe stale of horses, and the gilded puddleWhich beasts would cough at: thy palate then did deignThe roughest berry on the rudest hedge;Yea, like the stag, when snow the pasture sheets,The barks of trees thou browsed'st; on the AlpsIt is reported thou didst eat strange flesh,Which some did die to look on: and all this--It wounds thine honour that I speak it now--Was borne so like a soldier, that thy cheekSo much as lank'd not.

LEPIDUS

'Tis pity of him.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

Let his shames quicklyDrive him to Rome: 'tis time we twainDid show ourselves i' the field; and to that endAssemble we immediate council: PompeyThrives in our idleness.

LEPIDUS

To-morrow, Caesar,I shall be furnish'd to inform you rightlyBoth what by sea and land I can be ableTo front this present time.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

Till which encounter,It is my business too. Farewell.

LEPIDUS

Farewell, my lord: what you shall know meantimeOf stirs abroad, I shall beseech you, sir,To let me be partaker.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

Doubt not, sir;I knew it for my bond.Exeunt

SCENE V. Alexandria. CLEOPATRA's palace.

Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and MARDIAN


CLEOPATRA

Charmian!

CHARMIAN

Madam?

CLEOPATRA

Ha, ha!Give me to drink mandragora.

CHARMIAN

Why, madam?

CLEOPATRA

That I might sleep out this great gap of timeMy Antony is away.

CHARMIAN

                  You think of him too much.

CLEOPATRA

O, 'tis treason!

CHARMIAN

                  Madam, I trust, not so.

CLEOPATRA

Thou, eunuch Mardian!

MARDIAN

What's your highness' pleasure?

CLEOPATRA

Not now to hear thee sing; I take no pleasureIn aught an eunuch has: 'tis well for thee,That, being unseminar'd, thy freer thoughtsMay not fly forth of Egypt. Hast thou affections?

MARDIAN

Yes, gracious madam.

CLEOPATRA

Indeed!

MARDIAN

Not in deed, madam; for I can do nothingBut what indeed is honest to be done:Yet have I fierce affections, and thinkWhat Venus did with Mars.

CLEOPATRA

O Charmian,Where think'st thou he is now? Stands he, or sits he?Or does he walk? or is he on his horse?O happy horse, to bear the weight of Antony!Do bravely, horse! for wot'st thou whom thou movest?The demi-Atlas of this earth, the armAnd burgonet of men. He's speaking now,Or murmuring 'Where's my serpent of old Nile?'For so he calls me: now I feed myselfWith most delicious poison. Think on me,That am with Phoebus' amorous pinches black,And wrinkled deep in time? Broad-fronted Caesar,When thou wast here above the ground, I wasA morsel for a monarch: and great PompeyWould stand and make his eyes grow in my brow;There would he anchor his aspect and dieWith looking on his life.Enter ALEXAS, from OCTAVIUS CAESAR


ALEXAS

Sovereign of Egypt, hail!

CLEOPATRA

How much unlike art thou Mark Antony!Yet, coming from him, that great medicine hathWith his tinct gilded thee.How goes it with my brave Mark Antony?

ALEXAS

Last thing he did, dear queen,He kiss'd,--the last of many doubled kisses,--This orient pearl. His speech sticks in my heart.

CLEOPATRA

Mine ear must pluck it thence.

ALEXAS

'Good friend,' quoth he,'Say, the firm Roman to great Egypt sendsThis treasure of an oyster; at whose foot,To mend the petty present, I will pieceHer opulent throne with kingdoms; all the east,Say thou, shall call her mistress.' So he nodded,And soberly did mount an arm-gaunt steed,Who neigh'd so high, that what I would have spokeWas beastly dumb'd by him.

CLEOPATRA

What, was he sad or merry?

ALEXAS

Like to the time o' the year between the extremesOf hot and cold, he was nor sad nor merry.

CLEOPATRA

O well-divided disposition! Note him,Note him good Charmian, 'tis the man; but note him:He was not sad, for he would shine on thoseThat make their looks by his; he was not merry,Which seem'd to tell them his remembrance layIn Egypt with his joy; but between both:O heavenly mingle! Be'st thou sad or merry,The violence of either thee becomes,So does it no man else. Met'st thou my posts?

ALEXAS

Ay, madam, twenty several messengers:Why do you send so thick?

CLEOPATRA

Who's born that dayWhen I forget to send to Antony,Shall die a beggar. Ink and paper, Charmian.Welcome, my good Alexas. Did I, Charmian,Ever love Caesar so?

CHARMIAN

O that brave Caesar!

CLEOPATRA

Be choked with such another emphasis!Say, the brave Antony.

CHARMIAN

The valiant Caesar!

CLEOPATRA

By Isis, I will give thee bloody teeth,If thou with Caesar paragon againMy man of men.

CHARMIAN

                  By your most gracious pardon,I sing but after you.

CLEOPATRA

My salad days,When I was green in judgment: cold in blood,To say as I said then! But, come, away;Get me ink and paper:He shall have every day a several greeting,Or I'll unpeople Egypt.Exeunt

ACT II
SCENE I. Messina. POMPEY's house.

Enter POMPEY, MENECRATES, and MENAS, in warlike manner


POMPEY

If the great gods be just, they shall assistThe deeds of justest men.

MENECRATES

Know, worthy Pompey,That what they do delay, they not deny.

POMPEY

Whiles we are suitors to their throne, decaysThe thing we sue for.

MENECRATES

We, ignorant of ourselves,Beg often our own harms, which the wise powersDeny us for our good; so find we profitBy losing of our prayers.

POMPEY

I shall do well:The people love me, and the sea is mine;My powers are crescent, and my auguring hopeSays it will come to the full. Mark AntonyIn Egypt sits at dinner, and will makeNo wars without doors: Caesar gets money whereHe loses hearts: Lepidus flatters both,Of both is flatter'd; but he neither loves,Nor either cares for him.

MENAS

Caesar and LepidusAre in the field: a mighty strength they carry.

POMPEY

Where have you this? 'tis false.

MENAS

From Silvius, sir.

POMPEY

He dreams: I know they are in Rome together,Looking for Antony. But all the charms of love,Salt Cleopatra, soften thy waned lip!Let witchcraft join with beauty, lust with both!Tie up the libertine in a field of feasts,Keep his brain fuming; Epicurean cooksSharpen with cloyless sauce his appetite;That sleep and feeding may prorogue his honourEven till a Lethe'd dulness!Enter VARRIUS
How now, Varrius!

VARRIUS

This is most certain that I shall deliver:Mark Antony is every hour in RomeExpected: since he went from Egypt 'tisA space for further travel.

POMPEY

I could have given less matterA better ear. Menas, I did not thinkThis amorous surfeiter would have donn'd his helmFor such a petty war: his soldiershipIs twice the other twain: but let us rearThe higher our opinion, that our stirringCan from the lap of Egypt's widow pluckThe ne'er-lust-wearied Antony.

MENAS

I cannot hopeCaesar and Antony shall well greet together:His wife that's dead did trespasses to Caesar;His brother warr'd upon him; although, I think,Not moved by Antony.

POMPEY

I know not, Menas,How lesser enmities may give way to greater.Were't not that we stand up against them all,'Twere pregnant they should square betweenthemselves;For they have entertained cause enoughTo draw their swords: but how the fear of usMay cement their divisions and bind upThe petty difference, we yet not know.Be't as our gods will have't! It only standsOur lives upon to use our strongest hands.Come, Menas.Exeunt

SCENE II. Rome. The house of LEPIDUS.

Enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS and LEPIDUS


LEPIDUS

Good Enobarbus, 'tis a worthy deed,And shall become you well, to entreat your captainTo soft and gentle speech.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

I shall entreat himTo answer like himself: if Caesar move him,Let Antony look over Caesar's headAnd speak as loud as Mars. By Jupiter,Were I the wearer of Antonius' beard,I would not shave't to-day.

LEPIDUS

'Tis not a timeFor private stomaching.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

Every timeServes for the matter that is then born in't.

LEPIDUS

But small to greater matters must give way.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

Not if the small come first.

LEPIDUS

Your speech is passion:But, pray you, stir no embers up. Here comesThe noble Antony.Enter MARK ANTONY and VENTIDIUS


DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

                  And yonder, Caesar.Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, MECAENAS, and AGRIPPA


MARK ANTONY

If we compose well here, to Parthia:Hark, Ventidius.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

                  I do not know,Mecaenas; ask Agrippa.

LEPIDUS

Noble friends,That which combined us was most great, and let notA leaner action rend us. What's amiss,May it be gently heard: when we debateOur trivial difference loud, we do commitMurder in healing wounds: then, noble partners,The rather, for I earnestly beseech,Touch you the sourest points with sweetest terms,Nor curstness grow to the matter.

MARK ANTONY

'Tis spoken well.Were we before our armies, and to fight.I should do thus.Flourish


OCTAVIUS CAESAR

Welcome to Rome.

MARK ANTONY

                  Thank you.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

Sit.

MARK ANTONY

Sit, sir.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

Nay, then.

MARK ANTONY

I learn, you take things ill which are not so,Or being, concern you not.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

I must be laugh'd at,If, or for nothing or a little, IShould say myself offended, and with youChiefly i' the world; more laugh'd at, that I shouldOnce name you derogately, when to sound your nameIt not concern'd me.

MARK ANTONY

My being in Egypt, Caesar,What was't to you?

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

No more than my residing here at RomeMight be to you in Egypt: yet, if you thereDid practise on my state, your being in EgyptMight be my question.

MARK ANTONY

How intend you, practised?

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

You may be pleased to catch at mine intentBy what did here befal me. Your wife and brotherMade wars upon me; and their contestationWas theme for you, you were the word of war.

MARK ANTONY

You do mistake your business; my brother neverDid urge me in his act: I did inquire it;And have my learning from some true reports,That drew their swords with you. Did he not ratherDiscredit my authority with yours;And make the wars alike against my stomach,Having alike your cause? Of this my lettersBefore did satisfy you. If you'll patch a quarrel,As matter whole you have not to make it with,It must not be with this.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

You praise yourselfBy laying defects of judgment to me; butYou patch'd up your excuses.

MARK ANTONY

Not so, not so;I know you could not lack, I am certain on't,Very necessity of this thought, that I,Your partner in the cause 'gainst which he fought,Could not with graceful eyes attend those warsWhich fronted mine own peace. As for my wife,I would you had her spirit in such another:The third o' the world is yours; which with a snaffleYou may pace easy, but not such a wife.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

Would we had all such wives, that the men might goto wars with the women!

MARK ANTONY

So much uncurbable, her garboils, CaesarMade out of her impatience, which not wantedShrewdness of policy too, I grieving grantDid you too much disquiet: for that you mustBut say, I could not help it.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

I wrote to youWhen rioting in Alexandria; youDid pocket up my letters, and with tauntsDid gibe my missive out of audience.

MARK ANTONY

Sir,He fell upon me ere admitted: thenThree kings I had newly feasted, and did wantOf what I was i' the morning: but next dayI told him of myself; which was as muchAs to have ask'd him pardon. Let this fellowBe nothing of our strife; if we contend,Out of our question wipe him.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

You have brokenThe article of your oath; which you shall neverHave tongue to charge me with.

LEPIDUS

Soft, Caesar!

MARK ANTONY

No,Lepidus, let him speak:The honour is sacred which he talks on now,Supposing that I lack'd it. But, on, Caesar;The article of my oath.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

To lend me arms and aid when I required them;The which you both denied.

MARK ANTONY

Neglected, rather;And then when poison'd hours had bound me upFrom mine own knowledge. As nearly as I may,I'll play the penitent to you: but mine honestyShall not make poor my greatness, nor my powerWork without it. Truth is, that Fulvia,To have me out of Egypt, made wars here;For which myself, the ignorant motive, doSo far ask pardon as befits mine honourTo stoop in such a case.

LEPIDUS

'Tis noble spoken.

MECAENAS

If it might please you, to enforce no furtherThe griefs between ye: to forget them quiteWere to remember that the present needSpeaks to atone you.

LEPIDUS

Worthily spoken, Mecaenas.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

Or, if you borrow one another's love for theinstant, you may, when you hear no more words ofPompey, return it again: you shall have time towrangle in when you have nothing else to do.

MARK ANTONY

Thou art a soldier only: speak no more.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

That truth should be silent I had almost forgot.

MARK ANTONY

You wrong this presence; therefore speak no more.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

Go to, then; your considerate stone.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

I do not much dislike the matter, butThe manner of his speech; for't cannot beWe shall remain in friendship, our conditionsSo differing in their acts. Yet if I knewWhat hoop should hold us stanch, from edge to edgeO' the world I would pursue it.

AGRIPPA

Give me leave, Caesar,--

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

Speak, Agrippa.

AGRIPPA

Thou hast a sister by the mother's side,Admired Octavia: great Mark AntonyIs now a widower.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

                  Say not so, Agrippa:If Cleopatra heard you, your reproofWere well deserved of rashness.

MARK ANTONY

I am not married, Caesar: let me hearAgrippa further speak.

AGRIPPA

To hold you in perpetual amity,To make you brothers, and to knit your heartsWith an unslipping  knot, take AntonyOctavia to his wife; whose beauty claimsNo worse a husband than the best of men;Whose virtue and whose general graces speakThat which none else can utter. By this marriage,All little jealousies, which now seem great,And all great fears, which now import their dangers,Would then be nothing: truths would be tales,Where now half tales be truths: her love to bothWould, each to other and all loves to both,Draw after her. Pardon what I have spoke;For 'tis a studied, not a present thought,By duty ruminated.

MARK ANTONY

                  Will Caesar speak?

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

Not till he hears how Antony is touch'dWith what is spoke already.

MARK ANTONY

What power is in Agrippa,If I would say, 'Agrippa, be it so,'To make this good?

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

                  The power of Caesar, andHis power unto Octavia.

MARK ANTONY

May I neverTo this good purpose, that so fairly shows,Dream of impediment! Let me have thy hand:Further this act of grace: and from this hourThe heart of brothers govern in our lovesAnd sway our great designs!

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

There is my hand.A sister I bequeath you, whom no brotherDid ever love so dearly: let her liveTo join our kingdoms and our hearts; and neverFly off our loves again!

LEPIDUS

Happily, amen!

MARK ANTONY

I did not think to draw my sword 'gainst Pompey;For he hath laid strange courtesies and greatOf late upon me: I must thank him only,Lest my remembrance suffer ill report;At heel of that, defy him.

LEPIDUS

Time calls upon's:Of us must Pompey presently be sought,Or else he seeks out us.

MARK ANTONY

Where lies he?

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

About the mount Misenum.

MARK ANTONY

What is his strength by land?

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

Great and increasing: but by seaHe is an absolute master.

MARK ANTONY

So is the fame.Would we had spoke together! Haste we for it:Yet, ere we put ourselves in arms, dispatch weThe business we have talk'd of.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

With most gladness:And do invite you to my sister's view,Whither straight I'll lead you.

MARK ANTONY

Let us, Lepidus,Not lack your company.

LEPIDUS

Noble Antony,Not sickness should detain me.Flourish. Exeunt OCTAVIUS CAESAR, MARK ANTONY, and LEPIDUS


MECAENAS

Welcome from Egypt, sir.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

Half the heart of Caesar, worthy Mecaenas! Myhonourable friend, Agrippa!

AGRIPPA

Good Enobarbus!

MECAENAS

We have cause to be glad that matters are so welldigested. You stayed well by 't in Egypt.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

Ay, sir; we did sleep day out of countenance, andmade the night light with drinking.

MECAENAS

Eight wild-boars roasted whole at a breakfast, andbut twelve persons there; is this true?

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

This was but as a fly by an eagle: we had much moremonstrous matter of feast, which worthily deserved noting.

MECAENAS

She's a most triumphant lady, if report be square toher.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

When she first met Mark Antony, she pursed uphis heart, upon the river of Cydnus.

AGRIPPA

There she appeared indeed; or my reporter devisedwell for her.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

I will tell you.The barge she sat in, like a burnish'd throne,Burn'd on the water: the poop was beaten gold;Purple the sails, and so perfumed thatThe winds were love-sick with them; the oars were silver,Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and madeThe water which they beat to follow faster,As amorous of their strokes. For her own person,It beggar'd all description: she did lieIn her pavilion--cloth-of-gold of tissue--O'er-picturing that Venus where we seeThe fancy outwork nature: on each side herStood pretty dimpled boys, like smiling Cupids,With divers-colour'd fans, whose wind did seemTo glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool,And what they undid did.

AGRIPPA

O, rare for Antony!

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

Her gentlewomen, like the Nereides,So many mermaids, tended her i' the eyes,And made their bends adornings: at the helmA seeming mermaid steers: the silken tackleSwell with the touches of those flower-soft hands,That yarely frame the office. From the bargeA strange invisible perfume hits the senseOf the adjacent wharfs. The city castHer people out upon her; and Antony,Enthroned i' the market-place, did sit alone,Whistling to the air; which, but for vacancy,Had gone to gaze on Cleopatra too,And made a gap in nature.

AGRIPPA

Rare Egyptian!

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

Upon her landing, Antony sent to her,Invited her to supper: she replied,It should be better he became her guest;Which she entreated: our courteous Antony,Whom ne'er the word of 'No' woman heard speak,Being barber'd ten times o'er, goes to the feast,And for his ordinary pays his heartFor what his eyes eat only.

AGRIPPA

Royal wench!She made great Caesar lay his sword to bed:He plough'd her, and she cropp'd.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

I saw her onceHop forty paces through the public street;And having lost her breath, she spoke, and panted,That she did make defect perfection,And, breathless, power breathe forth.

MECAENAS

Now Antony must leave her utterly.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

Never; he will not:Age cannot wither her, nor custom staleHer infinite variety: other women cloyThe appetites they feed: but she makes hungryWhere most she satisfies; for vilest thingsBecome themselves in her: that the holy priestsBless her when she is riggish.

MECAENAS

If beauty, wisdom, modesty, can settleThe heart of Antony, Octavia isA blessed lottery to him.

AGRIPPA

Let us go.Good Enobarbus, make yourself my guestWhilst you abide here.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

Humbly, sir, I thank you.Exeunt

SCENE III. The same. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's house.

Enter MARK ANTONY, OCTAVIUS CAESAR, OCTAVIA between them, and Attendants


MARK ANTONY

The world and my great office will sometimesDivide me from your bosom.

OCTAVIA

All which timeBefore the gods my knee shall bow my prayersTo them for you.

MARK ANTONY

                  Good night, sir. My Octavia,Read not my blemishes in the world's report:I have not kept my square; but that to comeShall all be done by the rule. Good night, dear lady.Good night, sir.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

Good night.Exeunt OCTAVIUS CAESAR and OCTAVIA
Enter Soothsayer


MARK ANTONY

Now, sirrah; you do wish yourself in Egypt?

Soothsayer

Would I had never come from thence, nor you Thither!

MARK ANTONY

If you can, your reason?

Soothsayer

I see it inMy motion, have it not in my tongue: but yetHie you to Egypt again.

MARK ANTONY

Say to me,Whose fortunes shall rise higher, Caesar's or mine?

Soothsayer

Caesar's.Therefore, O Antony, stay not by his side:Thy demon, that's thy spirit which keeps thee, isNoble, courageous high, unmatchable,Where Caesar's is not; but, near him, thy angelBecomes a fear, as being o'erpower'd: thereforeMake space enough between you.

MARK ANTONY

Speak this no more.

Soothsayer

To none but thee; no more, but when to thee.If thou dost play with him at any game,Thou art sure to lose; and, of that natural luck,He beats thee 'gainst the odds: thy lustre thickens,When he shines by: I say again, thy spiritIs all afraid to govern thee near him;But, he away, 'tis noble.

MARK ANTONY

Get thee gone:Say to Ventidius I would speak with him:Exit Soothsayer
He shall to Parthia. Be it art or hap,He hath spoken true: the very dice obey him;And in our sports my better cunning faintsUnder his chance: if we draw lots, he speeds;His cocks do win the battle still of mine,When it is all to nought; and his quails everBeat mine, inhoop'd, at odds. I will to Egypt:And though I make this marriage for my peace,I' the east my pleasure lies.Enter VENTIDIUS
O, come, Ventidius,You must to Parthia: your commission's ready;Follow me, and receive't.Exeunt

SCENE IV. The same. A street.

Enter LEPIDUS, MECAENAS, and AGRIPPA


LEPIDUS

Trouble yourselves no further: pray you, hastenYour generals after.

AGRIPPA

Sir, Mark AntonyWill e'en but kiss Octavia, and we'll follow.

LEPIDUS

Till I shall see you in your soldier's dress,Which will become you both, farewell.

MECAENAS

We shall,As I conceive the journey, be at the MountBefore you, Lepidus.

LEPIDUS

Your way is shorter;My purposes do draw me much about:You'll win two days upon me.

MECAENAS

AGRIPPA

Sir, good success!

LEPIDUS

Farewell.Exeunt

SCENE V. Alexandria. CLEOPATRA's palace.

Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and ALEXAS


CLEOPATRA

Give me some music; music, moody foodOf us that trade in love.

Attendants

The music, ho!Enter MARDIAN


CLEOPATRA

Let it alone; let's to billiards: come, Charmian.

CHARMIAN

My arm is sore; best play with Mardian.

CLEOPATRA

As well a woman with an eunuch play'dAs with a woman. Come, you'll play with me, sir?

MARDIAN

As well as I can, madam.

CLEOPATRA

And when good will is show'd, though't cometoo short,The actor may plead pardon. I'll none now:Give me mine angle; we'll to the river: there,My music playing far off, I will betrayTawny-finn'd fishes; my bended hook shall pierceTheir slimy jaws; and, as I draw them up,I'll think them every one an Antony,And say 'Ah, ha! you're caught.'

CHARMIAN

'Twas merry whenYou wager'd on your angling; when your diverDid hang a salt-fish on his hook, which heWith fervency drew up.

CLEOPATRA

That time,--O times!--I laugh'd him out of patience; and that nightI laugh'd him into patience; and next morn,Ere the ninth hour, I drunk him to his bed;Then put my tires and mantles on him, whilstI wore his sword Philippan.Enter a Messenger
O, from ItalyRam thou thy fruitful tidings in mine ears,That long time have been barren.

Messenger

Madam, madam,--

CLEOPATRA

Antonius dead!--If thou say so, villain,Thou kill'st thy mistress: but well and free,If thou so yield him, there is gold, and hereMy bluest veins to kiss; a hand that kingsHave lipp'd, and trembled kissing.

Messenger

First, madam, he is well.

CLEOPATRA

Why, there's more gold.But, sirrah, mark, we useTo say the dead are well: bring it to that,The gold I give thee will I melt and pourDown thy ill-uttering throat.

Messenger

Good madam, hear me.

CLEOPATRA

Well, go to, I will;But there's no goodness in thy face: if AntonyBe free and healthful,--so tart a favourTo trumpet such good tidings! If not well,Thou shouldst come like a Fury crown'd with snakes,Not like a formal man.

Messenger

Will't please you hear me?

CLEOPATRA

I have a mind to strike thee ere thou speak'st:Yet if thou say Antony lives, is well,Or friends with Caesar, or not captive to him,I'll set thee in a shower of gold, and hailRich pearls upon thee.

Messenger

Madam, he's well.

CLEOPATRA

Well said.

Messenger

And friends with Caesar.

CLEOPATRA

Thou'rt an honest man.

Messenger

Caesar and he are greater friends than ever.

CLEOPATRA

Make thee a fortune from me.

Messenger

But yet, madam,--

CLEOPATRA

I do not like 'But yet,' it does allayThe good precedence; fie upon 'But yet'!'But yet' is as a gaoler to bring forthSome monstrous malefactor. Prithee, friend,Pour out the pack of matter to mine ear,The good and bad together: he's friends with Caesar:In state of health thou say'st; and thou say'st free.

Messenger

Free, madam! no; I made no such report:He's bound unto Octavia.

CLEOPATRA

For what good turn?

Messenger

For the best turn i' the bed.

CLEOPATRA

I am pale, Charmian.

Messenger

Madam, he's married to Octavia.

CLEOPATRA

The most infectious pestilence upon thee!Strikes him down


Messenger

Good madam, patience.

CLEOPATRA

What say you? Hence,Strikes him again
Horrible villain! or I'll spurn thine eyesLike balls before me; I'll unhair thy head:She hales him up and down
Thou shalt be whipp'd with wire, and stew'd in brine,Smarting in lingering pickle.

Messenger

Gracious madam,I that do bring the news made not the match.

CLEOPATRA

Say 'tis not so, a province I will give thee,And make thy fortunes proud: the blow thou hadstShall make thy peace for moving me to rage;And I will boot thee with what gift besideThy modesty can beg.

Messenger

He's married, madam.

CLEOPATRA

Rogue, thou hast lived too long.Draws a knife


Messenger

Nay, then I'll run.What mean you, madam? I have made no fault.Exit


CHARMIAN

Good madam, keep yourself within yourself:The man is innocent.

CLEOPATRA

Some innocents 'scape not the thunderbolt.Melt Egypt into Nile! and kindly creaturesTurn all to serpents! Call the slave again:Though I am mad, I will not bite him: call.

CHARMIAN

He is afeard to come.

CLEOPATRA

I will not hurt him.Exit CHARMIAN
These hands do lack nobility, that they strikeA meaner than myself; since I myselfHave given myself the cause.Re-enter CHARMIAN and Messenger
Come hither, sir.Though it be honest, it is never goodTo bring bad news: give to a gracious message.An host of tongues; but let ill tidings tellThemselves when they be felt.

Messenger

I have done my duty.

CLEOPATRA

Is he married?I cannot hate thee worser than I do,If thou again say 'Yes.'

Messenger

He's married, madam.

CLEOPATRA

The gods confound thee! dost thou hold there still?

Messenger

Should I lie, madam?

CLEOPATRA

O, I would thou didst,So half my Egypt were submerged and madeA cistern for scaled snakes! Go, get thee hence:Hadst thou Narcissus in thy face, to meThou wouldst appear most ugly. He is married?

Messenger

I crave your highness' pardon.

CLEOPATRA

He is married?

Messenger

Take no offence that I would not offend you:To punish me for what you make me do.Seems much unequal: he's married to Octavia.

CLEOPATRA

O, that his fault should make a knave of thee,That art not what thou'rt sure of! Get thee hence:The merchandise which thou hast brought from RomeAre all too dear for me: lie they upon thy hand,And be undone by 'em!Exit Messenger


CHARMIAN

Good your highness, patience.

CLEOPATRA

In praising Antony, I have dispraised Caesar.

CHARMIAN

Many times, madam.

CLEOPATRA

                  I am paid for't now.Lead me from hence:I faint: O Iras, Charmian! 'tis no matter.Go to the fellow, good Alexas; bid himReport the feature of Octavia, her years,Her inclination, let him not leave outThe colour of her hair: bring me word quickly.Exit ALEXAS
Let him for ever go:--let him not--Charmian,Though he be painted one way like a Gorgon,The other way's a Mars. Bid you AlexasTo MARDIAN
Bring me word how tall she is. Pity me, Charmian,But do not speak to me. Lead me to my chamber.Exeunt

SCENE VI. Near Misenum.

Flourish. Enter POMPEY and MENAS at one door,  with drum and trumpet: at another, OCTAVIUS CAESAR,  MARK ANTONY, LEPIDUS, DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS, MECAENAS, with Soldiers marching


POMPEY

Your hostages I have, so have you mine;And we shall talk before we fight.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

Most meetThat first we come to words; and therefore have weOur written purposes before us sent;Which, if thou hast consider'd, let us knowIf 'twill tie up thy discontented sword,And carry back to Sicily much tall youthThat else must perish here.

POMPEY

To you all three,The senators alone of this great world,Chief factors for the gods, I do not knowWherefore my father should revengers want,Having a son and friends; since Julius Caesar,Who at Philippi the good Brutus ghosted,There saw you labouring for him. What was'tThat moved pale Cassius to conspire; and whatMade the all-honour'd, honest Roman, Brutus,With the arm'd rest, courtiers and beauteous freedom,To drench the Capitol; but that they wouldHave one man but a man? And that is itHath made me rig my navy; at whose burthenThe anger'd ocean foams; with which I meantTo scourge the ingratitude that despiteful RomeCast on my noble father.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

Take your time.

MARK ANTONY

Thou canst not fear us, Pompey, with thy sails;We'll speak with thee at sea: at land, thou know'stHow much we do o'er-count thee.

POMPEY

At land, indeed,Thou dost o'er-count me of my father's house:But, since the cuckoo builds not for himself,Remain in't as thou mayst.

LEPIDUS

Be pleased to tell us--For this is from the present--how you takeThe offers we have sent you.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

There's the point.

MARK ANTONY

Which do not be entreated to, but weighWhat it is worth embraced.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

And what may follow,To try a larger fortune.

POMPEY

You have made me offerOf Sicily, Sardinia; and I mustRid all the sea of pirates; then, to sendMeasures of wheat to Rome; this 'greed uponTo part with unhack'd edges, and bear backOur targes undinted.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

MARK ANTONY

LEPIDUS

That's our offer.

POMPEY

Know, then,I came before you here a man preparedTo take this offer: but Mark AntonyPut me to some impatience: though I loseThe praise of it by telling, you must know,When Caesar and your brother were at blows,Your mother came to Sicily and did findHer welcome friendly.

MARK ANTONY

I have heard it, Pompey;And am well studied for a liberal thanksWhich I do owe you.

POMPEY

Let me have your hand:I did not think, sir, to have met you here.

MARK ANTONY

The beds i' the east are soft; and thanks to you,That call'd me timelier than my purpose hither;For I have gain'd by 't.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

Since I saw you last,There is a change upon you.

POMPEY

Well, I know notWhat counts harsh fortune casts upon my face;But in my bosom shall she never come,To make my heart her vassal.

LEPIDUS

Well met here.

POMPEY

I hope so, Lepidus. Thus we are agreed:I crave our composition may be written,And seal'd between us.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

That's the next to do.

POMPEY

We'll feast each other ere we part; and let'sDraw lots who shall begin.

MARK ANTONY

That will I, Pompey.

POMPEY

No, Antony, take the lot: but, firstOr last, your fine Egyptian cookeryShall have the fame. I have heard that Julius CaesarGrew fat with feasting there.

MARK ANTONY

You have heard much.

POMPEY

I have fair meanings, sir.

MARK ANTONY

And fair words to them.

POMPEY

Then so much have I heard:And I have heard, Apollodorus carried--

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

No more of that: he did so.

POMPEY

What, I pray you?

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

A certain queen to Caesar in a mattress.

POMPEY

I know thee now: how farest thou, soldier?

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

Well;And well am like to do; for, I perceive,Four feasts are toward.

POMPEY

Let me shake thy hand;I never hated thee: I have seen thee fight,When I have envied thy behavior.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

Sir,I never loved you much; but I ha' praised ye,When you have well deserved ten times as muchAs I have said you did.

POMPEY

Enjoy thy plainness,It nothing ill becomes thee.Aboard my galley I invite you all:Will you lead, lords?

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

MARK ANTONY

LEPIDUS

Show us the way, sir.

POMPEY

Come.Exeunt all but MENAS and ENOBARBUS


MENAS

[Aside]  Thy father, Pompey, would ne'er havemade this treaty.--You and I have known, sir.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

At sea, I think.

MENAS

We have, sir.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

You have done well by water.

MENAS

And you by land.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

I will praise any man that will praise me; though itcannot be denied what I have done by land.

MENAS

Nor what I have done by water.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

Yes, something you can deny for your ownsafety: you have been a great thief by sea.

MENAS

And you by land.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

There I deny my land service. But give me yourhand, Menas: if our eyes had authority, here theymight take two thieves kissing.

MENAS

All men's faces are true, whatsome'er their hands are.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

But there is never a fair woman has a true face.

MENAS

No slander; they steal hearts.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

We came hither to fight with you.

MENAS

For my part, I am sorry it is turned to a drinking.Pompey doth this day laugh away his fortune.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

If he do, sure, he cannot weep't back again.

MENAS

You've said, sir. We looked not for Mark Antonyhere: pray you, is he married to Cleopatra?

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

Caesar's sister is called Octavia.

MENAS

True, sir; she was the wife of Caius Marcellus.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

But she is now the wife of Marcus Antonius.

MENAS

Pray ye, sir?

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

'Tis true.

MENAS

Then is Caesar and he for ever knit together.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

If I were bound to divine of this unity, I wouldnot prophesy so.

MENAS

I think the policy of that purpose made more in themarriage than the love of the parties.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

I think so too. But you shall find, the band thatseems to tie their friendship together will be thevery strangler of their amity: Octavia is of aholy, cold, and still conversation.

MENAS

Who would not have his wife so?

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

Not he that himself is not so; which is Mark Antony.He will to his Egyptian dish again: then shall thesighs of Octavia blow the fire up in Caesar; and, asI said before, that which is the strength of theiramity shall prove the immediate author of theirvariance. Antony will use his affection where it is:he married but his occasion here.

MENAS

And thus it may be. Come, sir, will you aboard?I have a health for you.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

I shall take it, sir: we have used our throats in Egypt.

MENAS

Come, let's away.Exeunt

SCENE VII. On board POMPEY's galley, off Misenum.

Music plays. Enter two or three Servants with a banquet


First Servant

Here they'll be, man. Some o' their plants areill-rooted already: the least wind i' the worldwill blow them down.

Second Servant

Lepidus is high-coloured.

First Servant

They have made him drink alms-drink.

Second Servant

As they pinch one another by the disposition, hecries out 'No more;' reconciles them to hisentreaty, and himself to the drink.

First Servant

But it raises the greater war between him andhis discretion.

Second Servant

Why, this is to have a name in great men'sfellowship: I had as lief have a reed that will dome no service as a partisan I could not heave.

First Servant

To be called into a huge sphere, and not to be seento move in't, are the holes where eyes should be,which pitifully disaster the cheeks.A sennet sounded. Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, MARK  ANTONY, LEPIDUS, POMPEY, AGRIPPA, MECAENAS, DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS, MENAS, with other captains


MARK ANTONY

[To OCTAVIUS CAESAR]  Thus do they, sir: they takethe flow o' the NileBy certain scales i' the pyramid; they know,By the height, the lowness, or the mean, if dearthOr foison follow: the higher Nilus swells,The more it promises: as it ebbs, the seedsmanUpon the slime and ooze scatters his grain,And shortly comes to harvest.

LEPIDUS

You've strange serpents there.

MARK ANTONY

Ay, Lepidus.

LEPIDUS

Your serpent of Egypt is bred now of your mud by theoperation of your sun: so is your crocodile.

MARK ANTONY

They are so.

POMPEY

Sit,--and some wine! A health to Lepidus!

LEPIDUS

I am not so well as I should be, but I'll ne'er out.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

Not till you have slept; I fear me you'll be in till then.

LEPIDUS

Nay, certainly, I have heard the Ptolemies'pyramises are very goodly things; withoutcontradiction, I have heard that.

MENAS

[Aside to POMPEY]  Pompey, a word.

POMPEY

[Aside to MENAS]                 Say in mine ear:what is't?

MENAS

[Aside to POMPEY]  Forsake thy seat, I do beseechthee, captain,And hear me speak a word.

POMPEY

[Aside to MENAS]  Forbear me till anon.This wine for Lepidus!

LEPIDUS

What manner o' thing is your crocodile?

MARK ANTONY

It is shaped, sir, like itself; and it is as broadas it hath breadth: it is just so high as it is,and moves with its own organs: it lives by thatwhich nourisheth it; and the elements once out ofit, it transmigrates.

LEPIDUS

What colour is it of?

MARK ANTONY

Of it own colour too.

LEPIDUS

'Tis a strange serpent.

MARK ANTONY

'Tis so. And the tears of it are wet.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

Will this description satisfy him?

MARK ANTONY

With the health that Pompey gives him, else he is avery epicure.

POMPEY

[Aside to MENAS]  Go hang, sir, hang! Tell me ofthat? away!Do as I bid you. Where's this cup I call'd for?

MENAS

[Aside to POMPEY]  If for the sake of merit thouwilt hear me,Rise from thy stool.

POMPEY

[Aside to MENAS]  I think thou'rt mad.The matter?Rises, and walks aside


MENAS

I have ever held my cap off to thy fortunes.

POMPEY

Thou hast served me with much faith. What's else to say?Be jolly, lords.

MARK ANTONY

                  These quick-sands, Lepidus,Keep off them, for you sink.

MENAS

Wilt thou be lord of all the world?

POMPEY

What say'st thou?

MENAS

Wilt thou be lord of the whole world? That's twice.

POMPEY

How should that be?

MENAS

But entertain it,And, though thou think me poor, I am the manWill give thee all the world.

POMPEY

Hast thou drunk well?

MENAS

Now, Pompey, I have kept me from the cup.Thou art, if thou darest be, the earthly Jove:Whate'er the ocean pales, or sky inclips,Is thine, if thou wilt ha't.

POMPEY

Show me which way.

MENAS

These three world-sharers, these competitors,Are in thy vessel: let me cut the cable;And, when we are put off, fall to their throats:All there is thine.

POMPEY

Ah, this thou shouldst have done,And not have spoke on't! In me 'tis villany;In thee't had been good service. Thou must know,'Tis not my profit that does lead mine honour;Mine honour, it. Repent that e'er thy tongueHath so betray'd thine act: being done unknown,I should have found it afterwards well done;But must condemn it now. Desist, and drink.

MENAS

[Aside]  For this,I'll never follow thy pall'd fortunes more.Who seeks, and will not take when once 'tis offer'd,Shall never find it more.

POMPEY

This health to Lepidus!

MARK ANTONY

Bear him ashore. I'll pledge it for him, Pompey.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

Here's to thee, Menas!

MENAS

Enobarbus, welcome!

POMPEY

Fill till the cup be hid.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

There's a strong fellow, Menas.Pointing to the Attendant who carries off LEPIDUS


MENAS

Why?

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

A' bears the third part of the world, man; see'stnot?

MENAS

The third part, then, is drunk: would it were all,That it might go on wheels!

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

Drink thou; increase the reels.

MENAS

Come.

POMPEY

This is not yet an Alexandrian feast.

MARK ANTONY

It ripens towards it. Strike the vessels, ho?Here is to Caesar!

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

                  I could well forbear't.It's monstrous labour, when I wash my brain,And it grows fouler.

MARK ANTONY

Be a child o' the time.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

Possess it, I'll make answer:But I had rather fast from all four daysThan drink so much in one.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

Ha, my brave emperor!To MARK ANTONY
Shall we dance now the Egyptian Bacchanals,And celebrate our drink?

POMPEY

Let's ha't, good soldier.

MARK ANTONY

Come, let's all take hands,Till that the conquering wine hath steep'd our senseIn soft and delicate Lethe.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

All take hands.Make battery to our ears with the loud music:The while I'll place you: then the boy shall sing;The holding every man shall bear as loudAs his strong sides can volley.Music plays. DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS places them hand in hand
THE SONG.Come, thou monarch of the vine,Plumpy Bacchus with pink eyne!In thy fats our cares be drown'd,With thy grapes our hairs be crown'd:Cup us, till the world go round,Cup us, till the world go round!

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

What would you more? Pompey, good night. Good brother,Let me request you off: our graver businessFrowns at this levity. Gentle lords, let's part;You see we have burnt our cheeks: strong EnobarbIs weaker than the wine; and mine own tongueSplits what it speaks: the wild disguise hath almostAntick'd us all. What needs more words? Good night.Good Antony, your hand.

POMPEY

I'll try you on the shore.

MARK ANTONY

And shall, sir; give's your hand.

POMPEY

O Antony,You have my father's house,--But, what? we are friends.Come, down into the boat.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

Take heed you fall not.Exeunt all but DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS and MENAS
Menas, I'll not on shore.

MENAS

No, to my cabin.These drums! these trumpets, flutes! what!Let Neptune hear we bid a loud farewellTo these great fellows: sound and be hang'd, sound out!Sound a flourish, with drums


DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

Ho! says a' There's my cap.

MENAS

Ho! Noble captain, come.Exeunt

ACT III
SCENE I. A plain in Syria.

Enter VENTIDIUS as it were in triumph, with SILIUS,  and other Romans, Officers, and Soldiers; the dead body of PACORUS borne before him


VENTIDIUS

Now, darting Parthia, art thou struck; and nowPleased fortune does of Marcus Crassus' deathMake me revenger. Bear the king's son's bodyBefore our army. Thy Pacorus, Orodes,Pays this for Marcus Crassus.

SILIUS

Noble Ventidius,Whilst yet with Parthian blood thy sword is warm,The fugitive Parthians follow; spur through Media,Mesopotamia, and the shelters whitherThe routed fly: so thy grand captain AntonyShall set thee on triumphant chariots andPut garlands on thy head.

VENTIDIUS

O Silius, Silius,I have done enough; a lower place, note well,May make too great an act: for learn this, Silius;Better to leave undone, than by our deedAcquire too high a fame when him we serve's away.Caesar and Antony have ever wonMore in their officer than person: Sossius,One of my place in Syria, his lieutenant,For quick accumulation of renown,Which he achieved by the minute, lost his favour.Who does i' the wars more than his captain canBecomes his captain's captain: and ambition,The soldier's virtue, rather makes choice of loss,Than gain which darkens him.I could do more to do Antonius good,But 'twould offend him; and in his offenceShould my performance perish.

SILIUS

Thou hast, Ventidius,thatWithout the which a soldier, and his sword,Grants scarce distinction. Thou wilt write to Antony!

VENTIDIUS

I'll humbly signify what in his name,That magical word of war, we have effected;How, with his banners and his well-paid ranks,The ne'er-yet-beaten horse of ParthiaWe have jaded out o' the field.

SILIUS

Where is he now?

VENTIDIUS

He purposeth to Athens: whither, with what hasteThe weight we must convey with's will permit,We shall appear before him. On there; pass along!Exeunt

SCENE II. Rome. An ante-chamber in OCTAVIUS CAESAR's house.

Enter AGRIPPA at one door, DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS at another


AGRIPPA

What, are the brothers parted?

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

They have dispatch'd with Pompey, he is gone;The other three are sealing. Octavia weepsTo part from Rome; Caesar is sad; and Lepidus,Since Pompey's feast, as Menas says, is troubledWith the green sickness.

AGRIPPA

'Tis a noble Lepidus.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

A very fine one: O, how he loves Caesar!

AGRIPPA

Nay, but how dearly he adores Mark Antony!

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

Caesar? Why, he's the Jupiter of men.

AGRIPPA

What's Antony? The god of Jupiter.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

Spake you of Caesar? How! the non-pareil!

AGRIPPA

O Antony! O thou Arabian bird!

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

Would you praise Caesar, say 'Caesar:' go no further.

AGRIPPA

Indeed, he plied them both with excellent praises.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

But he loves Caesar best; yet he loves Antony:Ho! hearts, tongues, figures, scribes, bards,poets, cannotThink, speak, cast, write, sing, number, ho!His love to Antony. But as for Caesar,Kneel down, kneel down, and wonder.

AGRIPPA

Both he loves.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

They are his shards, and he their beetle.Trumpets within
So;This is to horse. Adieu, noble Agrippa.

AGRIPPA

Good fortune, worthy soldier; and farewell.Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, MARK ANTONY, LEPIDUS, and OCTAVIA


MARK ANTONY

No further, sir.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

You take from me a great part of myself;Use me well in 't. Sister, prove such a wifeAs my thoughts make thee, and as my farthest bandShall pass on thy approof. Most noble Antony,Let not the piece of virtue, which is setBetwixt us as the cement of our love,To keep it builded, be the ram to batterThe fortress of it; for better might weHave loved without this mean, if on both partsThis be not cherish'd.

MARK ANTONY

Make me not offendedIn your distrust.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

                  I have said.

MARK ANTONY

You shall not find,Though you be therein curious, the least causeFor what you seem to fear: so, the gods keep you,And make the hearts of Romans serve your ends!We will here part.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

Farewell, my dearest sister, fare thee well:The elements be kind to thee, and makeThy spirits all of comfort! fare thee well.

OCTAVIA

My noble brother!

MARK ANTONY

The April 's in her eyes: it is love's spring,And these the showers to bring it on. Be cheerful.

OCTAVIA

Sir, look well to my husband's house; and--

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

What, Octavia?

OCTAVIA

       I'll tell you in your ear.

MARK ANTONY

Her tongue will not obey her heart, nor canHer heart inform her tongue,--the swan'sdown-feather,That stands upon the swell at full of tide,And neither way inclines.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

[Aside to AGRIPPA]  Will Caesar weep?

AGRIPPA

[Aside to DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS]  He has a cloud in 's face.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

[Aside to AGRIPPA]  He were the worse for that,were he a horse;So is he, being a man.

AGRIPPA

[Aside to DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS]  Why, Enobarbus,When Antony found Julius Caesar dead,He cried almost to roaring; and he weptWhen at Philippi he found Brutus slain.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

[Aside to AGRIPPA]  That year, indeed, he wastroubled with a rheum;What willingly he did confound he wail'd,Believe't, till I wept too.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

No, sweet Octavia,You shall hear from me still; the time shall notOut-go my thinking on you.

MARK ANTONY

Come, sir, come;I'll wrestle with you in my strength of love:Look, here I have you; thus I let you go,And give you to the gods.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

Adieu; be happy!

LEPIDUS

Let all the number of the stars give lightTo thy fair way!

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

Farewell, fa rewell!Kisses OCTAVIA


MARK ANTONY

Farewell!Trumpets sound. Exeunt

SCENE III. Alexandria. CLEOPATRA's palace.

Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and ALEXAS


CLEOPATRA

Where is the fellow?

ALEXAS

Half afeard to come.

CLEOPATRA

Go to, go to.Enter the Messenger as before
Come hither, sir.

ALEXAS

Good majesty,Herod of Jewry dare not look upon youBut when you are well pleased.

CLEOPATRA

That Herod's headI'll have: but how, when Antony is goneThrough whom I might command it? Come thou near.

Messenger

Most gracious majesty,--

CLEOPATRA

Didst thou behold Octavia?

Messenger

Ay, dread queen.

CLEOPATRA

Where?

Messenger

Madam, in Rome;I look'd her in the face, and saw her ledBetween her brother and Mark Antony.

CLEOPATRA

Is she as tall as me?

Messenger

She is not, madam.

CLEOPATRA

Didst hear her speak? is she shrill-tongued or low?

Messenger

Madam, I heard her speak; she is low-voiced.

CLEOPATRA

That's not so good: he cannot like her long.

CHARMIAN

Like her! O Isis! 'tis impossible.

CLEOPATRA

I think so, Charmian: dull of tongue, and dwarfish!What majesty is in her gait? Remember,If e'er thou look'dst on majesty.

Messenger

She creeps:Her motion and her station are as one;She shows a body rather than a life,A statue than a breather.

CLEOPATRA

Is this certain?

Messenger

Or I have no observance.

CHARMIAN

Three in EgyptCannot make better note.

CLEOPATRA

He's very knowing;I do perceive't: there's nothing in her yet:The fellow has good judgment.

CHARMIAN

Excellent.

CLEOPATRA

Guess at her years, I prithee.

Messenger

Madam,She was a widow,--

CLEOPATRA

                  Widow! Charmian, hark.

Messenger

And I do think she's thirty.

CLEOPATRA

Bear'st thou her face in mind? is't long or round?

Messenger

Round even to faultiness.

CLEOPATRA

For the most part, too, they are foolish that are so.Her hair, what colour?

Messenger

Brown, madam: and her foreheadAs low as she would wish it.

CLEOPATRA

There's gold for thee.Thou must not take my former sharpness ill:I will employ thee back again; I find theeMost fit for business: go make thee ready;Our letters are prepared.Exit Messenger


CHARMIAN

A proper man.

CLEOPATRA

Indeed, he is so: I repent me muchThat so I harried him. Why, methinks, by him,This creature's no such thing.

CHARMIAN

Nothing, madam.

CLEOPATRA

The man hath seen some majesty, and should know.

CHARMIAN

Hath he seen majesty? Isis else defend,And serving you so long!

CLEOPATRA

I have one thing more to ask him yet, good Charmian:But 'tis no matter; thou shalt bring him to meWhere I will write. All may be well enough.

CHARMIAN

I warrant you, madam.Exeunt

SCENE IV. Athens. A room in MARK ANTONY's house.

Enter MARK ANTONY and OCTAVIA


MARK ANTONY

Nay, nay, Octavia, not only that,--That were excusable, that, and thousands moreOf semblable import,--but he hath wagedNew wars 'gainst Pompey; made his will, and read itTo public ear:Spoke scantly of me: when perforce he could notBut pay me terms of honour, cold and sicklyHe vented them; most narrow measure lent me:When the best hint was given him, he not took't,Or did it from his teeth.

OCTAVIA

O my good lord,Believe not all; or, if you must believe,Stomach not all. A more unhappy lady,If this division chance, ne'er stood between,Praying for both parts:The good gods me presently,When I shall pray, 'O bless my lord and husband!'Undo that prayer, by crying out as loud,'O, bless my brother!' Husband win, win brother,Prays, and destroys the prayer; no midway'Twixt these extremes at all.

MARK ANTONY

Gentle Octavia,Let your best love draw to that point, which seeksBest to preserve it: if I lose mine honour,I lose myself: better I were not yoursThan yours so branchless. But, as you requested,Yourself shall go between 's: the mean time, lady,I'll raise the preparation of a warShall stain your brother: make your soonest haste;So your desires are yours.

OCTAVIA

Thanks to my lord.The Jove of power make me most weak, most weak,Your reconciler! Wars 'twixt you twain would beAs if the world should cleave, and that slain menShould solder up the rift.

MARK ANTONY

When it appears to you where this begins,Turn your displeasure that way: for our faultsCan never be so equal, that your loveCan equally move with them. Provide your going;Choose your own company, and command what costYour heart has mind to.Exeunt

SCENE V. The same. Another room.

Enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS and EROS, meeting


DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

How now, friend Eros!

EROS

There's strange news come, sir.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

What, man?

EROS

Caesar and Lepidus have made wars upon Pompey.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

This is old: what is the success?

EROS

Caesar, having made use of him in the wars 'gainstPompey, presently denied him rivality; would not lethim partake in the glory of the action: and notresting here, accuses him of letters he had formerlywrote to Pompey; upon his own appeal, seizes him: sothe poor third is up, till death enlarge his confine.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

Then, world, thou hast a pair of chaps, no more;And throw between them all the food thou hast,They'll grind the one the other. Where's Antony?

EROS

He's walking in the garden--thus; and spurnsThe rush that lies before him; cries, 'Fool Lepidus!'And threats the throat of that his officerThat murder'd Pompey.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

Our great navy's rigg'd.

EROS

For Italy and Caesar. More, Domitius;My lord desires you presently: my newsI might have told hereafter.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

'Twill be naught:But let it be. Bring me to Antony.

EROS

Come, sir.Exeunt

SCENE VI. Rome. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's house.

Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, AGRIPPA, and MECAENAS


OCTAVIUS CAESAR

Contemning Rome, he has done all this, and more,In Alexandria: here's the manner of 't:I' the market-place, on a tribunal silver'd,Cleopatra and himself in chairs of goldWere publicly enthroned: at the feet satCaesarion, whom they call my father's son,And all the unlawful issue that their lustSince then hath made between them. Unto herHe gave the stablishment of Egypt; made herOf lower Syria, Cyprus, Lydia,Absolute queen.

MECAENAS

                  This in the public eye?

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

I' the common show-place, where they exercise.His sons he there proclaim'd the kings of kings:Great Media, Parthia, and Armenia.He gave to Alexander; to Ptolemy he assign'dSyria, Cilicia, and Phoenicia: sheIn the habiliments of the goddess IsisThat day appear'd; and oft before gave audience,As 'tis reported, so.

MECAENAS

Let Rome be thus Inform'd.

AGRIPPA

Who, queasy with his insolenceAlready, will their good thoughts call from him.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

The people know it; and have now receivedHis accusations.

AGRIPPA

                  Who does he accuse?

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

Caesar: and that, having in SicilySextus Pompeius spoil'd, we had not rated himHis part o' the isle: then does he say, he lent meSome shipping unrestored: lastly, he fretsThat Lepidus of the triumvirateShould be deposed; and, being, that we detainAll his revenue.

AGRIPPA

                  Sir, this should be answer'd.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

'Tis done already, and the messenger gone.I have told him, Lepidus was grown too cruel;That he his high authority abused,And did deserve his change: for what I have conquer'd,I grant him part; but then, in his Armenia,And other of his conquer'd kingdoms, IDemand the like.

MECAENAS

                  He'll never yield to that.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

Nor must not then be yielded to in this.Enter OCTAVIA with her train


OCTAVIA

Hail, Caesar, and my lord! hail, most dear Caesar!

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

That ever I should call thee castaway!

OCTAVIA

You have not call'd me so, nor have you cause.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

Why have you stol'n upon us thus! You come notLike Caesar's sister: the wife of AntonyShould have an army for an usher, andThe neighs of horse to tell of her approachLong ere she did appear; the trees by the wayShould have borne men; and expectation fainted,Longing for what it had not; nay, the dustShould have ascended to the roof of heaven,Raised by your populous troops: but you are comeA market-maid to Rome; and have preventedThe ostentation of our love, which, left unshown,Is often left unloved; we should have met youBy sea and land; supplying every stageWith an augmented greeting.

OCTAVIA

Good my lord,To come thus was I not constrain'd, but didOn my free will. My lord, Mark Antony,Hearing that you prepared for war, acquaintedMy grieved ear withal; whereon, I begg'dHis pardon for return.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

Which soon he granted,Being an obstruct 'tween his lust and him.

OCTAVIA

Do not say so, my lord.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

I have eyes upon him,And his affairs come to me on the wind.Where is he now?

OCTAVIA

                  My lord, in Athens.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

No, my most wronged sister; CleopatraHath nodded him to her. He hath given his empireUp to a whore; who now are levyingThe kings o' the earth for war; he hath assembledBocchus, the king of Libya; Archelaus,Of Cappadocia; Philadelphos, kingOf Paphlagonia; the Thracian king, Adallas;King Malchus of Arabia; King of Pont;Herod of Jewry; Mithridates, kingOf Comagene; Polemon and Amyntas,The kings of Mede and Lycaonia,With a more larger list of sceptres.

OCTAVIA

Ay me, most wretched,That have my heart parted betwixt two friendsThat do afflict each other!

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

Welcome hither:Your letters did withhold our breaking forth;Till we perceived, both how you were wrong led,And we in negligent danger. Cheer your heart;Be you not troubled with the time, which drivesO'er your content these strong necessities;But let determined things to destinyHold unbewail'd their way. Welcome to Rome;Nothing more dear to me. You are abusedBeyond the mark of thought: and the high gods,To do you justice, make them ministersOf us and those that love you. Best of comfort;And ever welcome to us.

AGRIPPA

Welcome, lady.

MECAENAS

Welcome, dear madam.Each heart in Rome does love and pity you:Only the adulterous Antony, most largeIn his abominations, turns you off;And gives his potent regiment to a trull,That noises it against us.

OCTAVIA

Is it so, sir?

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

Most certain. Sister, welcome: pray you,Be ever known to patience: my dear'st sister!Exeunt

SCENE VII. Near Actium. MARK ANTONY's camp.

Enter CLEOPATRA and DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS


CLEOPATRA

I will be even with thee, doubt it not.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

But why, why, why?

CLEOPATRA

Thou hast forspoke my being in these wars,And say'st it is not fit.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

Well, is it, is it?

CLEOPATRA

If not denounced against us, why should not weBe there in person?

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

[Aside]  Well, I could reply:If we should serve with horse and mares together,The horse were merely lost; the mares would bearA soldier and his horse.

CLEOPATRA

What is't you say?

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

Your presence needs must puzzle Antony;Take from his heart, take from his brain,from's time,What should not then be spared. He is alreadyTraduced for levity; and 'tis said in RomeThat Photinus an eunuch and your maidsManage this war.

CLEOPATRA

                  Sink Rome, and their tongues rotThat speak against us! A charge we bear i' the war,And, as the president of my kingdom, willAppear there for a man. Speak not against it:I will not stay behind.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

Nay, I have done.Here comes the emperor.Enter MARK ANTONY and CANIDIUS


MARK ANTONY

Is it not strange, Canidius,That from Tarentum and BrundusiumHe could so quickly cut the Ionian sea,And take in Toryne? You have heard on't, sweet?

CLEOPATRA

Celerity is never more admiredThan by the negligent.

MARK ANTONY

A good rebuke,Which might have well becomed the best of men,To taunt at slackness. Canidius, weWill fight with him by sea.

CLEOPATRA

By sea! what else?

CANIDIUS

Why will my lord do so?

MARK ANTONY

For that he dares us to't.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

So hath my lord dared him to single fight.

CANIDIUS

Ay, and to wage this battle at Pharsalia.Where Caesar fought with Pompey: but these offers,Which serve not for his vantage, be shakes off;And so should you.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

                  Your ships are not well mann'd;Your mariners are muleters, reapers, peopleIngross'd by swift impress; in Caesar's fleetAre those that often have 'gainst Pompey fought:Their ships are yare; yours, heavy: no disgraceShall fall you for refusing him at sea,Being prepared for land.

MARK ANTONY

By sea, by sea.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

Most worthy sir, you therein throw awayThe absolute soldiership you have by land;Distract your army, which doth most consistOf war-mark'd footmen; leave unexecutedYour own renowned knowledge; quite foregoThe way which promises assurance; andGive up yourself merely to chance and hazard,From firm security.

MARK ANTONY

I'll fight at sea.

CLEOPATRA

I have sixty sails, Caesar none better.

MARK ANTONY

Our overplus of shipping will we burn;And, with the rest full-mann'd, from the head of ActiumBeat the approaching Caesar. But if we fail,We then can do't at land.Enter a Messenger
Thy business?

Messenger

The news is true, my lord; he is descried;Caesar has taken Toryne.

MARK ANTONY

Can he be there in person? 'tis impossible;Strange that power should be. Canidius,Our nineteen legions thou shalt hold by land,And our twelve thousand horse. We'll to our ship:Away, my Thetis!Enter a Soldier
How now, worthy soldier?

Soldier

O noble emperor, do not fight by sea;Trust not to rotten planks: do you misdoubtThis sword and these my wounds? Let the EgyptiansAnd the Phoenicians go a-ducking; weHave used to conquer, standing on the earth,And fighting foot to foot.

MARK ANTONY

Well, well: away!Exeunt MARK ANTONY, QUEEN CLEOPATRA, and DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS


Soldier

By Hercules, I think I am i' the right.

CANIDIUS

Soldier, thou art: but his whole action growsNot in the power on't: so our leader's led,And we are women's men.

Soldier

You keep by landThe legions and the horse whole, do you not?

CANIDIUS

Marcus Octavius, Marcus Justeius,Publicola, and Caelius, are for sea:But we keep whole by land. This speed of Caesar'sCarries beyond belief.

Soldier

While he was yet in Rome,His power went out in such distractions asBeguiled all spies.

CANIDIUS

Who's his lieutenant, hear you?

Soldier

They say, one Taurus.

CANIDIUS

Well I know the man.Enter a Messenger


Messenger

The emperor calls Canidius.

CANIDIUS

With news the time's with labour, and throes forth,Each minute, some.Exeunt

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

Taurus!

TAURUS

My lord?

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

Strike not by land; keep whole: provoke not battle,Till we have done at sea. Do not exceedThe prescript of this scroll: our fortune liesUpon this jump.Exeunt

SCENE IX. Another part of the plain.

Enter MARK ANTONY and DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS


MARK ANTONY

Set we our squadrons on yond side o' the hill,In eye of Caesar's battle; from which placeWe may the number of the ships behold,And so proceed accordingly.Exeunt

SCENE X. Another part of the plain.

CANIDIUS marcheth with his land army one way over  the stage; and TAURUS, the lieutenant of OCTAVIUS  CAESAR, the other way. After their going in, is heard the noise of a sea-fight


Alarum. Enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS


DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

Naught, naught all, naught! I can behold no longer:The Antoniad, the Egyptian admiral,With all their sixty, fly and turn the rudder:To see't mine eyes are blasted.Enter SCARUS


SCARUS

Gods and goddesses,All the whole synod of them!

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

What's thy passion!

SCARUS

The greater cantle of the world is lostWith very ignorance; we have kiss'd awayKingdoms and provinces.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

How appears the fight?

SCARUS

On our side like the token'd pestilence,Where death is sure. Yon ribaudred nag of Egypt,--Whom leprosy o'ertake!--i' the midst o' the fight,When vantage like a pair of twins appear'd,Both as the same, or rather ours the elder,The breese upon her, like a cow in June,Hoists sails and flies.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

That I beheld:Mine eyes did sicken at the sight, and could notEndure a further view.

SCARUS

She once being loof'd,The noble ruin of her magic, Antony,Claps on his sea-wing, and, like a doting mallard,Leaving the fight in height, flies after her:I never saw an action of such shame;Experience, manhood, honour, ne'er beforeDid violate so itself.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

Alack, alack!Enter CANIDIUS


CANIDIUS

Our fortune on the sea is out of breath,And sinks most lamentably. Had our generalBeen what he knew himself, it had gone well:O, he has given example for our flight,Most grossly, by his own!

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

Ay, are you thereabouts?Why, then, good night indeed.

CANIDIUS

Toward Peloponnesus are they fled.

SCARUS

'Tis easy to't; and there I will attendWhat further comes.

CANIDIUS

To Caesar will I renderMy legions and my horse: six kings alreadyShow me the way of yielding.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

I'll yet followThe wounded chance of Antony, though my reasonSits in the wind against me.Exeunt

SCENE XI. Alexandria. CLEOPATRA's palace.

Enter MARK ANTONY with Attendants


MARK ANTONY

Hark! the land bids me tread no more upon't;It is ashamed to bear me! Friends, come hither:I am so lated in the world, that IHave lost my way for ever: I have a shipLaden with gold; take that, divide it; fly,And make your peace with Caesar.

All

Fly! not we.

MARK ANTONY

I have fled myself; and have instructed cowardsTo run and show their shoulders. Friends, be gone;I have myself resolved upon a courseWhich has no need of you; be gone:My treasure's in the harbour, take it. O,I follow'd that I blush to look upon:My very hairs do mutiny; for the whiteReprove the brown for rashness, and they themFor fear and doting. Friends, be gone: you shallHave letters from me to some friends that willSweep your way for you. Pray you, look not sad,Nor make replies of loathness: take the hintWhich my despair proclaims; let that be leftWhich leaves itself: to the sea-side straightway:I will possess you of that ship and treasure.Leave me, I pray, a little: pray you now:Nay, do so; for, indeed, I have lost command,Therefore I pray you: I'll see you by and by.Sits down
Enter CLEOPATRA led by CHARMIAN and IRAS; EROS following


EROS

Nay, gentle madam, to him, comfort him.

IRAS

Do, most dear queen.

CHARMIAN

Do! why: what else?

CLEOPATRA

Let me sit down. O Juno!

MARK ANTONY

No, no, no, no, no.

EROS

See you here, sir?

MARK ANTONY

O fie, fie, fie!

CHARMIAN

Madam!

IRAS

Madam, O good empress!

EROS

Sir, sir,--

MARK ANTONY

Yes, my lord, yes; he at Philippi keptHis sword e'en like a dancer; while I struckThe lean and wrinkled Cassius; and 'twas IThat the mad Brutus ended: he aloneDealt on lieutenantry, and no practise hadIn the brave squares of war: yet now--No matter.

CLEOPATRA

Ah, stand by.

EROS

The queen, my lord, the queen.

IRAS

Go to him, madam, speak to him:He is unqualitied with very shame.

CLEOPATRA

Well then, sustain him: O!

EROS

Most noble sir, arise; the queen approaches:Her head's declined, and death will seize her, butYour comfort makes the rescue.

MARK ANTONY

I have offended reputation,A most unnoble swerving.

EROS

Sir, the queen.

MARK ANTONY

O, whither hast thou led me, Egypt? See,How I convey my shame out of thine eyesBy looking back what I have left behind'Stroy'd in dishonour.

CLEOPATRA

O my lord, my lord,Forgive my fearful sails! I little thoughtYou would have follow'd.

MARK ANTONY

Egypt, thou knew'st too wellMy heart was to thy rudder tied by the strings,And thou shouldst tow me after: o'er my spiritThy full supremacy thou knew'st, and thatThy beck might from the bidding of the godsCommand me.

CLEOPATRA

          O, my pardon!

MARK ANTONY

Now I mustTo the young man send humble treaties, dodgeAnd palter in the shifts of lowness; whoWith half the bulk o' the world play'd as I pleased,Making and marring fortunes. You did knowHow much you were my conqueror; and thatMy sword, made weak by my affection, wouldObey it on all cause.

CLEOPATRA

Pardon, pardon!

MARK ANTONY

Fall not a tear, I say; one of them ratesAll that is won and lost: give me a kiss;Even this repays me. We sent our schoolmaster;Is he come back? Love, I am full of lead.Some wine, within there, and our viands! Fortune knowsWe scorn her most when most she offers blows.Exeunt

SCENE XII. Egypt. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's camp.

Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, DOLABELLA, THYREUS, with others


OCTAVIUS CAESAR

Let him appear that's come from Antony.Know you him?

DOLABELLA

                  Caesar, 'tis his schoolmaster:An argument that he is pluck'd, when hitherHe sends so poor a pinion off his wing,Which had superfluous kings for messengersNot many moons gone by.Enter EUPHRONIUS, ambassador from MARK ANTONY


OCTAVIUS CAESAR

Approach, and speak.

EUPHRONIUS

Such as I am, I come from Antony:I was of late as petty to his endsAs is the morn-dew on the myrtle-leafTo his grand sea.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

                  Be't so: declare thine office.

EUPHRONIUS

Lord of his fortunes he salutes thee, andRequires to live in Egypt: which not granted,He lessens his requests; and to thee suesTo let him breathe between the heavens and earth,A private man in Athens: this for him.Next, Cleopatra does confess thy greatness;Submits her to thy might; and of thee cravesThe circle of the Ptolemies for her heirs,Now hazarded to thy grace.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

For Antony,I have no ears to his request. The queenOf audience nor desire shall fail, so sheFrom Egypt drive her all-disgraced friend,Or take his life there: this if she perform,She shall not sue unheard. So to them both.

EUPHRONIUS

Fortune pursue thee!

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

Bring him through the bands.Exit EUPHRONIUS
To THYREUS
From Antony win Cleopatra: promise,And in our name, what she requires; add more,From thine invention, offers: women are notIn their best fortunes strong; but want will perjureThe ne'er touch'd vestal: try thy cunning, Thyreus;Make thine own edict for thy pains, which weWill answer as a law.

THYREUS

Caesar, I go.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

Observe how Antony becomes his flaw,And what thou think'st his very action speaksIn every power that moves.

THYREUS

Caesar, I shall.Exeunt

SCENE XIII. Alexandria. CLEOPATRA's palace.

Enter CLEOPATRA, DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS, CHARMIAN, and IRAS


CLEOPATRA

What shall we do, Enobarbus?

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

Think, and die.

CLEOPATRA

Is Antony or we in fault for this?

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

Antony only, that would make his willLord of his reason. What though you fledFrom that great face of war, whose several rangesFrighted each other? why should he follow?The itch of his affection should not thenHave nick'd his captainship; at such a point,When half to half the world opposed, he beingThe meered question: 'twas a shame no lessThan was his loss, to course your flying flags,And leave his navy gazing.

CLEOPATRA

Prithee, peace.Enter MARK ANTONY with EUPHRONIUS, the Ambassador


MARK ANTONY

Is that his answer?

EUPHRONIUS

Ay, my lord.

MARK ANTONY

The queen shall then have courtesy, so sheWill yield us up.

EUPHRONIUS

                  He says so.

MARK ANTONY

Let her know't.To the boy Caesar send this grizzled head,And he will fill thy wishes to the brimWith principalities.

CLEOPATRA

That head, my lord?

MARK ANTONY

To him again: tell him he wears the roseOf youth upon him; from which the world should noteSomething particular: his coin, ships, legions,May be a coward's; whose ministers would prevailUnder the service of a child as soonAs i' the command of Caesar: I dare him thereforeTo lay his gay comparisons apart,And answer me declined, sword against sword,Ourselves alone. I'll write it: follow me.Exeunt MARK ANTONY and EUPHRONIUS


DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

[Aside]  Yes, like enough, high-battled Caesar willUnstate his happiness, and be staged to the show,Against a sworder! I see men's judgments areA parcel of their fortunes; and things outwardDo draw the inward quality after them,To suffer all alike. That he should dream,Knowing all measures, the full Caesar willAnswer his emptiness! Caesar, thou hast subduedHis judgment too.Enter an Attendant


Attendant

                  A messenger from CAESAR.

CLEOPATRA

What, no more ceremony? See, my women!Against the blown rose may they stop their noseThat kneel'd unto the buds. Admit him, sir.Exit Attendant


DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

[Aside]  Mine honesty and I begin to square.The loyalty well held to fools does makeOur faith mere folly: yet he that can endureTo follow with allegiance a fall'n lordDoes conquer him that did his master conquerAnd earns a place i' the story.Enter THYREUS


CLEOPATRA

Caesar's will?

THYREUS

Hear it apart.

CLEOPATRA

                  None but friends: say boldly.

THYREUS

So, haply, are they friends to Antony.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

He needs as many, sir, as Caesar has;Or needs not us. If Caesar please, our masterWill leap to be his friend: for us, you know,Whose he is we are, and that is, Caesar's.

THYREUS

So.Thus then, thou most renown'd: Caesar entreats,Not to consider in what case thou stand'st,Further than he is Caesar.

CLEOPATRA

Go on: right royal.

THYREUS

He knows that you embrace not AntonyAs you did love, but as you fear'd him.

CLEOPATRA

O!

THYREUS

The scars upon your honour, therefore, heDoes pity, as constrained blemishes,Not as deserved.

CLEOPATRA

                  He is a god, and knowsWhat is most right: mine honour was not yielded,But conquer'd merely.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

[Aside]             To be sure of that,I will ask Antony. Sir, sir, thou art so leaky,That we must leave thee to thy sinking, forThy dearest quit thee.Exit


THYREUS

Shall I say to CaesarWhat you require of him? for he partly begsTo be desired to give. It much would please him,That of his fortunes you should make a staffTo lean upon: but it would warm his spirits,To hear from me you had left Antony,And put yourself under his shrowd,The universal landlord.

CLEOPATRA

What's your name?

THYREUS

My name is Thyreus.

CLEOPATRA

Most kind messenger,Say to great Caesar this: in deputationI kiss his conquering hand: tell him, I am promptTo lay my crown at 's feet, and there to kneel:Tell him from his all-obeying breath I hearThe doom of Egypt.

THYREUS

'Tis your noblest course.Wisdom and fortune combating together,If that the former dare but what it can,No chance may shake it. Give me grace to layMy duty on your hand.

CLEOPATRA

Your Caesar's father oft,When he hath mused of taking kingdoms in,Bestow'd his lips on that unworthy place,As it rain'd kisses.Re-enter MARK ANTONY and DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS


MARK ANTONY

Favours, by Jove that thunders!What art thou, fellow?

THYREUS

One that but performsThe bidding of the fullest man, and worthiestTo have command obey'd.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

[Aside]               You will be whipp'd.

MARK ANTONY

Approach, there! Ah, you kite! Now, godsand devils!Authority melts from me: of late, when I cried 'Ho!'Like boys unto a muss, kings would start forth,And cry 'Your will?' Have you no ears? I amAntony yet.Enter Attendants
Take hence this Jack, and whip him.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

[Aside]  'Tis better playing with a lion's whelpThan with an old one dying.

MARK ANTONY

Moon and stars!Whip him. Were't twenty of the greatest tributariesThat do acknowledge Caesar, should I find themSo saucy with the hand of she here,--what's her name,Since she was Cleopatra? Whip him, fellows,Till, like a boy, you see him cringe his face,And whine aloud for mercy: take him hence.

THYREUS

Mark Antony!

MARK ANTONY

                  Tug him away: being whipp'd,Bring him again: this Jack of Caesar's shallBear us an errand to him.Exeunt Attendants with THYREUS
You were half blasted ere I knew you: ha!Have I my pillow left unpress'd in Rome,Forborne the getting of a lawful race,And by a gem of women, to be abusedBy one that looks on feeders?

CLEOPATRA

Good my lord,--

MARK ANTONY

You have been a boggler ever:But when we in our viciousness grow hard--O misery on't!--the wise gods seel our eyes;In our own filth drop our clear judgments; make usAdore our errors; laugh at's, while we strutTo our confusion.

CLEOPATRA

                  O, is't come to this?

MARK ANTONY

I found you as a morsel cold uponDead Caesar's trencher; nay, you were a fragmentOf Cneius Pompey's; besides what hotter hours,Unregister'd in vulgar fame, you haveLuxuriously pick'd out: for, I am sure,Though you can guess what temperance should be,You know not what it is.

CLEOPATRA

Wherefore is this?

MARK ANTONY

To let a fellow that will take rewardsAnd say 'God quit you!' be familiar withMy playfellow, your hand; this kingly sealAnd plighter of high hearts! O, that I wereUpon the hill of Basan, to outroarThe horned herd! for I have savage cause;And to proclaim it civilly, were likeA halter'd neck which does the hangman thankFor being yare about him.Re-enter Attendants with THYREUS
Is he whipp'd?

First Attendant

Soundly, my lord.

MARK ANTONY

                  Cried he? and begg'd a' pardon?

First Attendant

He did ask favour.

MARK ANTONY

If that thy father live, let him repentThou wast not made his daughter; and be thou sorryTo follow Caesar in his triumph, sinceThou hast been whipp'd for following him: henceforthThe white hand of a lady fever thee,Shake thou to look on 't. Get thee back to Caesar,Tell him thy entertainment: look, thou sayHe makes me angry with him; for he seemsProud and disdainful, harping on what I am,Not what he knew I was: he makes me angry;And at this time most easy 'tis to do't,When my good stars, that were my former guides,Have empty left their orbs, and shot their firesInto the abysm of hell. If he mislikeMy speech and what is done, tell him he hasHipparchus, my enfranched bondman, whomHe may at pleasure whip, or hang, or torture,As he shall like, to quit me: urge it thou:Hence with thy stripes, begone!Exit THYREUS


CLEOPATRA

Have you done yet?

MARK ANTONY

                  Alack, our terrene moonIs now eclipsed; and it portends aloneThe fall of Antony!

CLEOPATRA

I must stay his time.

MARK ANTONY

To flatter Caesar, would you mingle eyesWith one that ties his points?

CLEOPATRA

Not know me yet?

MARK ANTONY

Cold-hearted toward me?

CLEOPATRA

Ah, dear, if I be so,From my cold heart let heaven engender hail,And poison it in the source; and the first stoneDrop in my neck: as it determines, soDissolve my life! The next Caesarion smite!Till by degrees the memory of my womb,Together with my brave Egyptians all,By the discandying of this pelleted storm,Lie graveless, till the flies and gnats of NileHave buried them for prey!

MARK ANTONY

I am satisfied.Caesar sits down in Alexandria; whereI will oppose his fate. Our force by landHath nobly held; our sever'd navy tooHave knit again, and fleet, threatening most sea-like.Where hast thou been, my heart? Dost thou hear, lady?If from the field I shall return once moreTo kiss these lips, I will appear in blood;I and my sword will earn our chronicle:There's hope in't yet.

CLEOPATRA

That's my brave lord!

MARK ANTONY

I will be treble-sinew'd, hearted, breathed,And fight maliciously: for when mine hoursWere nice and lucky, men did ransom livesOf me for jests; but now I'll set my teeth,And send to darkness all that stop me. Come,Let's have one other gaudy night: call to meAll my sad captains; fill our bowls once more;Let's mock the midnight bell.

CLEOPATRA

It is my birth-day:I had thought to have held it poor: but, since my lordIs Antony again, I will be Cleopatra.

MARK ANTONY

We will yet do well.

CLEOPATRA

Call all his noble captains to my lord.

MARK ANTONY

Do so, we'll speak to them; and to-night I'll forceThe wine peep through their scars. Come on, my queen;There's sap in't yet. The next time I do fight,I'll make death love me; for I will contendEven with his pestilent scythe.Exeunt all but DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS


DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

Now he'll outstare the lightning. To be furious,Is to be frighted out of fear; and in that moodThe dove will peck the estridge; and I see still,A diminution in our captain's brainRestores his heart: when valour preys on reason,It eats the sword it fights with. I will seekSome way to leave him.Exit

ACT IV
SCENE I. Before Alexandria. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's camp.

Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, AGRIPPA, and MECAENAS, with his Army; OCTAVIUS CAESAR reading a letter


OCTAVIUS CAESAR

He calls me boy; and chides, as he had powerTo beat me out of Egypt; my messengerHe hath whipp'd with rods; dares me to personal combat,Caesar to Antony: let the old ruffian knowI have many other ways to die; meantimeLaugh at his challenge.

MECAENAS

Caesar must think,When one so great begins to rage, he's huntedEven to falling. Give him no breath, but nowMake boot of his distraction: never angerMade good guard for itself.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

Let our best headsKnow, that to-morrow the last of many battlesWe mean to fight: within our files there are,Of those that served Mark Antony but late,Enough to fetch him in. See it done:And feast the army; we have store to do't,And they have earn'd the waste. Poor Antony!Exeunt

SCENE II. Alexandria. CLEOPATRA's palace.

Enter MARK ANTONY, CLEOPATRA, DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS, CHARMIAN, IRAS, ALEXAS, with others


MARK ANTONY

He will not fight with me, Domitius.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

No.

MARK ANTONY

Why should he not?

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

He thinks, being twenty times of better fortune,He is twenty men to one.

MARK ANTONY

To-morrow, soldier,By sea and land I'll fight: or I will live,Or bathe my dying honour in the bloodShall make it live again. Woo't thou fight well?

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

I'll strike, and cry 'Take all.'

MARK ANTONY

Well said; come on.Call forth my household servants: let's to-nightBe bounteous at our meal.Enter three or four Servitors
Give me thy hand,Thou hast been rightly honest;--so hast thou;--Thou,--and thou,--and thou:--you have served me well,And kings have been your fellows.

CLEOPATRA

[Aside to DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS]  What means this?

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

[Aside to CLEOPATRA]  'Tis one of those oddtricks which sorrow shootsOut of the mind.

MARK ANTONY

                  And thou art honest too.I wish I could be made so many men,And all of you clapp'd up together inAn Antony, that I might do you serviceSo good as you have done.

All

The gods forbid!

MARK ANTONY

Well, my good fellows, wait on me to-night:Scant not my cups; and make as much of meAs when mine empire was your fellow too,And suffer'd my command.

CLEOPATRA

[Aside to DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS]  What does he mean?

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

[Aside to CLEOPATRA]  To make his followers weep.

MARK ANTONY

Tend me to-night;May be it is the period of your duty:Haply you shall not see me more; or if,A mangled shadow: perchance to-morrowYou'll serve another master. I look on youAs one that takes his leave. Mine honest friends,I turn you not away; but, like a masterMarried to your good service, stay till death:Tend me to-night two hours, I ask no more,And the gods yield you for't!

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

What mean you, sir,To give them this discomfort? Look, they weep;And I, an ass, am onion-eyed: for shame,Transform us not to women.

MARK ANTONY

Ho, ho, ho!Now the witch take me, if I meant it thus!Grace grow where those drops fall!My hearty friends,You take me in too dolorous a sense;For I spake to you for your comfort; did desire youTo burn this night with torches: know, my hearts,I hope well of to-morrow; and will lead youWhere rather I'll expect victorious lifeThan death and honour. Let's to supper, come,And drown consideration.Exeunt

SCENE III. The same. Before the palace.

Enter two Soldiers to their guard

Second Soldier

Hark!

First Soldier

    Music i' the air.

Third Soldier

Under the earth.

Fourth Soldier

It signs well, does it not?

Third Soldier

No.

First Soldier

Peace, I say!What should this mean?

Second Soldier

'Tis the god Hercules, whom Antony loved,Now leaves him.

First Soldier

Walk; let's see if other watchmenDo hear what we do?They advance to another post


Second Soldier

How now, masters!

All

[Speaking together]  How now!How now! do you hear this?

First Soldier

Ay; is't not strange?

Third Soldier

Do you hear, masters? do you hear?

First Soldier

Follow the noise so far as we have quarter;Let's see how it will give off.

All

Soldier

The gods make this a happy day to Antony!

MARK ANTONY

Would thou and those thy scars had once prevail'dTo make me fight at land!

Soldier

Hadst thou done so,The kings that have revolted, and the soldierThat has this morning left thee, would have stillFollow'd thy heels.

MARK ANTONY

Who's gone this morning?

Soldier

Who!One ever near thee: call for Enobarbus,He shall not hear thee; or from Caesar's campSay 'I am none of thine.'

MARK ANTONY

What say'st thou?

Soldier

Sir,He is with Caesar.

EROS

                  Sir, his chests and treasureHe has not with him.

Is he gone?

Soldier

Most certain.

I am alone the villain of the earth,And feel I am so most. O Antony,Thou mine of bounty, how wouldst thou have paidMy better service, when my turpitudeThou dost so crown with gold! This blows my heart:If swift thought break it not, a swifter meanShall outstrike thought: but thought will do't, I feel.I fight against thee! No: I will go seekSome ditch wherein to die; the foul'st best fitsMy latter part of life.Exit

SCENE VII. Field of battle between the camps.

Alarum. Drums and trumpets. Enter AGRIPPA and others


AGRIPPA

Retire, we have engaged ourselves too far:Caesar himself has work, and our oppressionExceeds what we expected.Exeunt
Alarums. Enter MARK ANTONY and SCARUS wounded


SCARUS

O my brave emperor, this is fought indeed!Had we done so at first, we had droven them homeWith clouts about their heads.

MARK ANTONY

Thou bleed'st apace.

SCARUS

I had a wound here that was like a T,But now 'tis made an H.

MARK ANTONY

They do retire.

SCARUS

We'll beat 'em into bench-holes: I have yetRoom for six scotches more.Enter EROS


EROS

They are beaten, sir, and our advantage servesFor a fair victory.

SCARUS

Let us score their backs,And snatch 'em up, as we take hares, behind:'Tis sport to maul a runner.

MARK ANTONY

I will reward theeOnce for thy spritely comfort, and ten-foldFor thy good valour. Come thee on.

SCARUS

I'll halt after.Exeunt

SCENE VIII. Under the walls of Alexandria.

Alarum. Enter MARK ANTONY, in a march; SCARUS, with others


MARK ANTONY

We have beat him to his camp: run one before,And let the queen know of our gests. To-morrow,Before the sun shall see 's, we'll spill the bloodThat has to-day escaped. I thank you all;For doughty-handed are you, and have foughtNot as you served the cause, but as 't had beenEach man's like mine; you have shown all Hectors.Enter the city, clip your wives, your friends,Tell them your feats; whilst they with joyful tearsWash the congealment from your wounds, and kissThe honour'd gashes whole.To SCARUS
Give me thy handEnter CLEOPATRA, attended
To this great fairy I'll commend thy acts,Make her thanks bless thee.To CLEOPATRA
O thou day o' the world,Chain mine arm'd neck; leap thou, attire and all,Through proof of harness to my heart, and thereRide on the pants triumphing!

CLEOPATRA

Lord of lords!O infinite virtue, comest thou smiling fromThe world's great snare uncaught?

MARK ANTONY

My nightingale,We have beat them to their beds. What, girl!though greyDo something mingle with our younger brown, yet ha' weA brain that nourishes our nerves, and canGet goal for goal of youth. Behold this man;Commend unto his lips thy favouring hand:Kiss it, my warrior: he hath fought to-dayAs if a god, in hate of mankind, hadDestroy'd in such a shape.

CLEOPATRA

I'll give thee, friend,An armour all of gold; it was a king's.

MARK ANTONY

He has deserved it, were it carbuncledLike holy Phoebus' car. Give me thy hand:Through Alexandria make a jolly march;Bear our hack'd targets like the men that owe them:Had our great palace the capacityTo camp this host, we all would sup together,And drink carouses to the next day's fate,Which promises royal peril. Trumpeters,With brazen din blast you the city's ear;Make mingle with rattling tabourines;That heaven and earth may strike their sounds together,Applauding our approach.Exeunt

SCENE IX. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's camp.

Sentinels at their post


First Soldier

If we be not relieved within this hour,We must return to the court of guard: the nightIs shiny; and they say we shall embattleBy the second hour i' the morn.

Second Soldier

This last day wasA shrewd one to's.Enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS


DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

                  O, bear me witness, night,--

Third Soldier

What man is this?

Second Soldier

                  Stand close, and list him.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

Be witness to me, O thou blessed moon,When men revolted shall upon recordBear hateful memory, poor Enobarbus didBefore thy face repent!

First Soldier

Enobarbus!

Third Soldier

Peace!Hark further.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

O sovereign mistress of true melancholy,The poisonous damp of night disponge upon me,That life, a very rebel to my will,May hang no longer on me: throw my heartAgainst the flint and hardness of my fault:Which, being dried with grief, will break to powder,And finish all foul thoughts. O Antony,Nobler than my revolt is infamous,Forgive me in thine own particular;But let the world rank me in registerA master-leaver and a fugitive:O Antony! O Antony!Dies


Second Soldier

Let's speak To him.

First Soldier

Let's hear him, for the things he speaksMay concern Caesar.

Third Soldier

Let's do so. But he sleeps.

First Soldier

Swoons rather; for so bad a prayer as hisWas never yet for sleep.

Second Soldier

Go we to him.

Third Soldier

Awake, sir, awake; speak to us.

Second Soldier

Hear you, sir?

First Soldier

The hand of death hath raught him.Drums afar off
Hark! the drumsDemurely wake the sleepers. Let us bear himTo the court of guard; he is of note: our hourIs fully out.

Third Soldier

Come on, then;He may recover yet.Exeunt with the body

SCENE X. Between the two camps.

Enter MARK ANTONY and SCARUS, with their Army


MARK ANTONY

Their preparation is to-day by sea;We please them not by land.

SCARUS

For both, my lord.

MARK ANTONY

I would they'ld fight i' the fire or i' the air;We'ld fight there too. But this it is; our footUpon the hills adjoining to the cityShall stay with us: order for sea is given;They have put forth the havenWhere their appointment we may best discover,And look on their endeavour.Exeunt

SCENE XI. Another part of the same.

Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, and his Army


OCTAVIUS CAESAR

But being charged, we will be still by land,Which, as I take't, we shall; for his best forceIs forth to man his galleys. To the vales,And hold our best advantage.Exeunt

SCENE XII. Another part of the same.

Enter MARK ANTONY and SCARUS


MARK ANTONY

Yet they are not join'd: where yond pinedoes stand,I shall discover all: I'll bring thee wordStraight, how 'tis like to go.Exit


SCARUS

Swallows have builtIn Cleopatra's sails their nests: the augurersSay they know not, they cannot tell; look grimly,And dare not speak their knowledge. AntonyIs valiant, and dejected; and, by starts,His fretted fortunes give him hope, and fear,Of what he has, and has not.Alarum afar off, as at a sea-fight
Re-enter MARK ANTONY


MARK ANTONY

All is lost;This foul Egyptian hath betrayed me:My fleet hath yielded to the foe; and yonderThey cast their caps up and carouse togetherLike friends long lost. Triple-turn'd whore!'tis thouHast sold me to this novice; and my heartMakes only wars on thee. Bid them all fly;For when I am revenged upon my charm,I have done all. Bid them all fly; begone.Exit SCARUS
O sun, thy uprise shall I see no more:Fortune and Antony part here; even hereDo we shake hands. All come to this? The heartsThat spaniel'd me at heels, to whom I gaveTheir wishes, do discandy, melt their sweetsOn blossoming Caesar; and this pine is bark'd,That overtopp'd them all. Betray'd I am:O this false soul of Egypt! this grave charm,--Whose eye beck'd forth my wars, and call'd them home;Whose bosom was my crownet, my chief end,--Like a right gipsy, hath, at fast and loose,Beguiled me to the very heart of loss.What, Eros, Eros!Enter CLEOPATRA
Ah, thou spell! Avaunt!

CLEOPATRA

Why is my lord enraged against his love?

MARK ANTONY

Vanish, or I shall give thee thy deserving,And blemish Caesar's triumph. Let him take thee,And hoist thee up to the shouting plebeians:Follow his chariot, like the greatest spotOf all thy sex; most monster-like, be shownFor poor'st diminutives, for doits; and letPatient Octavia plough thy visage upWith her prepared nails.Exit CLEOPATRA
'Tis well thou'rt gone,If it be well to live; but better 'twereThou fell'st into my fury, for one deathMight have prevented many. Eros, ho!The shirt of Nessus is upon me: teach me,Alcides, thou mine ancestor, thy rage:Let me lodge Lichas on the horns o' the moon;And with those hands, that grasp'd the heaviest club,Subdue my worthiest self. The witch shall die:To the young Roman boy she hath sold me, and I fallUnder this plot; she dies for't. Eros, ho!Exit

SCENE XIII. Alexandria. Cleopatra's palace.

Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and MARDIAN


CLEOPATRA

Help me, my women! O, he is more madThan Telamon for his shield; the boar of ThessalyWas never so emboss'd.

CHARMIAN

To the monument!There lock yourself, and send him word you are dead.The soul and body rive not more in partingThan greatness going off.

CLEOPATRA

To the monument!Mardian, go tell him I have slain myself;Say, that the last I spoke was 'Antony,'And word it, prithee, piteously: hence, Mardian,And bring me how he takes my death.To the monument!Exeunt

SCENE XIV. The same. Another room.

Enter MARK ANTONY and EROS


MARK ANTONY

Eros, thou yet behold'st me?

EROS

Ay, noble lord.

MARK ANTONY

Sometimes we see a cloud that's dragonish;A vapour sometime like a bear or lion,A tower'd citadel, a pendent rock,A forked mountain, or blue promontoryWith trees upon't, that nod unto the world,And mock our eyes with air: thou hast seenthese signs;They are black vesper's pageants.

EROS

Ay, my lord,

MARK ANTONY

That which is now a horse, even with a thoughtThe rack dislimns, and makes it indistinct,As water is in water.

EROS

It does, my lord.

MARK ANTONY

My good knave Eros, now thy captain isEven such a body: here I am Antony:Yet cannot hold this visible shape, my knave.I made these wars for Egypt: and the queen,--Whose heart I thought I had, for she had mine;Which whilst it was mine had annex'd unto'tA million more, now lost,--she, Eros, hasPack'd cards with Caesar, and false-play'd my gloryUnto an enemy's triumph.Nay, weep not, gentle Eros; there is left usOurselves to end ourselves.Enter MARDIAN
O! thy vile lady!She has robb'd me of my sword.

MARDIAN

No, Antony;My mistress loved thee, and her fortunes mingledWith thine entirely.

MARK ANTONY

Hence, saucy eunuch; peace!She hath betray'd me and shall die the death.

MARDIAN

Death of one person can be paid but once,And that she has discharged: what thou wouldst doIs done unto thy hand: the last she spakeWas 'Antony! most noble Antony!'Then in the midst a tearing groan did breakThe name of Antony; it was dividedBetween her heart and lips: she render'd life,Thy name so buried in her.

MARK ANTONY

Dead, then?

MARDIAN

Dead.

MARK ANTONY

Unarm, Eros; the long day's task is done,And we must sleep.To MARDIAN
That thou depart'st hence safe,Does pay thy labour richly; go.Exit MARDIAN
Off, pluck off:The seven-fold shield of Ajax cannot keepThe battery from my heart. O, cleave, my sides!Heart, once be stronger than thy continent,Crack thy frail case! Apace, Eros, apace.No more a soldier: bruised pieces, go;You have been nobly borne. From me awhile.Exit EROS
I will o'ertake thee, Cleopatra, andWeep for my pardon. So it must be, for nowAll length is torture: since the torch is out,Lie down, and stray no farther: now all labourMars what it does; yea, very force entanglesItself with strength: seal then, and all is done.Eros!--I come, my queen:--Eros!--Stay for me:Where souls do couch on flowers, we'll hand in hand,And with our sprightly port make the ghosts gaze:Dido and her AEneas shall want troops,And all the haunt be ours. Come, Eros, Eros!Re-enter EROS


EROS

What would my lord?

MARK ANTONY

Since Cleopatra died,I have lived in such dishonour, that the godsDetest my baseness. I, that with my swordQuarter'd the world, and o'er green Neptune's backWith ships made cities, condemn myself to lackThe courage of a woman; less noble mindThan she which by her death our Caesar tells'I am conqueror of myself.' Thou art sworn, Eros,That, when the exigent should come, which nowIs come indeed, when I should see behind meThe inevitable prosecution ofDisgrace and horror, that, on my command,Thou then wouldst kill me: do't; the time is come:Thou strikest not me, 'tis Caesar thou defeat'st.Put colour in thy cheek.

EROS

The gods withhold me!Shall I do that which all the Parthian darts,Though enemy, lost aim, and could not?

MARK ANTONY

Eros,Wouldst thou be window'd in great Rome and seeThy master thus with pleach'd arms, bending downHis corrigible neck, his face subduedTo penetrative shame, whilst the wheel'd seatOf fortunate Caesar, drawn before him, brandedHis baseness that ensued?

EROS

I would not see't.

MARK ANTONY

Come, then; for with a wound I must be cured.Draw that thy honest sword, which thou hast wornMost useful for thy country.

EROS

O, sir, pardon me!

MARK ANTONY

When I did make thee free, sworest thou not thenTo do this when I bade thee? Do it at once;Or thy precedent services are allBut accidents unpurposed. Draw, and come.

EROS

Turn from me, then, that noble countenance,Wherein the worship of the whole world lies.

MARK ANTONY

Lo thee!Turning from him


EROS

My sword is drawn.

MARK ANTONY

                  Then let it do at onceThe thing why thou hast drawn it.

EROS

My dear master,My captain, and my emperor, let me say,Before I strike this bloody stroke, farewell.

MARK ANTONY

'Tis said, man; and farewell.

EROS

Farewell, great chief. Shall I strike now?

MARK ANTONY

Now, Eros.

EROS

Why, there then: thus I do escape the sorrowOf Antony's death.Kills himself


MARK ANTONY

                  Thrice-nobler than myself!Thou teachest me, O valiant Eros, whatI should, and thou couldst not. My queen and ErosHave by their brave instruction got upon meA nobleness in record: but I will beA bridegroom in my death, and run into'tAs to a lover's bed. Come, then; and, Eros,Thy master dies thy scholar: to do thusFalling on his sword
I learn'd of thee. How! not dead? not dead?The guard, ho! O, dispatch me!Enter DERCETAS and Guard


First Guard

What's the noise?

MARK ANTONY

I have done my work in, friends: O, make an endOf what I have begun.

Second Guard

The star is fall'n.

First Guard

And time is at his period.

All

Alas, and woe!

MARK ANTONY

Let him that loves me strike me dead.

First Guard

Not I.

Second Guard

Nor I.

Third Guard

Nor any one.Exeunt Guard


DERCETAS

Thy death and fortunes bid thy followers fly.This sword but shown to Caesar, with this tidings,Shall enter me with him.Enter DIOMEDES


DIOMEDES

Where's Antony?

DERCETAS

                  There, Diomed there.

DIOMEDES

Lives he?Wilt thou not answer, man?Exit DERCETAS


MARK ANTONY

Art thou there, Diomed? Draw thy sword, and give meSufficing strokes for death.

DIOMEDES

Most absolute lord,My mistress Cleopatra sent me to thee.

MARK ANTONY

When did she send thee?

DIOMEDES

Now, my lord.

MARK ANTONY

Where is she?

DIOMEDES

Lock'd in her monument. She had a prophesying fearOf what hath come to pass: for when she saw--Which never shall be found--you did suspectShe had disposed with Caesar, and that your rageWould not be purged, she sent you word she was dead;But, fearing since how it might work, hath sentMe to proclaim the truth; and I am come,I dread, too late.

MARK ANTONY

Too late, good Diomed: call my guard, I prithee.

DIOMEDES

What, ho, the emperor's guard! The guard, what, ho!Come, your lord calls!Enter four or five of the Guard of MARK ANTONY


MARK ANTONY

Bear me, good friends, where Cleopatra bides;'Tis the last service that I shall command you.

First Guard

Woe, woe are we, sir, you may not live to wearAll your true followers out.

All

Most heavy day!

MARK ANTONY

Nay, good my fellows, do not please sharp fateTo grace it with your sorrows: bid that welcomeWhich comes to punish us, and we punish itSeeming to bear it lightly. Take me up:I have led you oft: carry me now, good friends,And have my thanks for all.Exeunt, bearing MARK ANTONY

SCENE XV. The same. A monument.

Enter CLEOPATRA and her maids aloft, with CHARMIAN and IRAS


CLEOPATRA

O Charmian, I will never go from hence.

CHARMIAN

Be comforted, dear madam.

CLEOPATRA

No, I will not:All strange and terrible events are welcome,But comforts we despise; our size of sorrow,Proportion'd to our cause, must be as greatAs that which makes it.Enter, below, DIOMEDES
How now! is he dead?

DIOMEDES

His death's upon him, but not dead.Look out o' the other side your monument;His guard have brought him thither.Enter, below, MARK ANTONY, borne by the Guard


CLEOPATRA

O sun,Burn the great sphere thou movest in!darkling standThe varying shore o' the world. O Antony,Antony, Antony! Help, Charmian, help, Iras, help;Help, friends below; let's draw him hither.

MARK ANTONY

Peace!Not Caesar's valour hath o'erthrown Antony,But Antony's hath triumph'd on itself.

CLEOPATRA

So it should be, that none but AntonyShould conquer Antony; but woe 'tis so!

MARK ANTONY

I am dying, Egypt, dying; onlyI here importune death awhile, untilOf many thousand kisses the poor lastI lay up thy lips.

CLEOPATRA

                  I dare not, dear,--Dear my lord, pardon,--I dare not,Lest I be taken: not the imperious showOf the full-fortuned Caesar ever shallBe brooch'd with me; if knife, drugs,serpents, haveEdge, sting, or operation, I am safe:Your wife Octavia, with her modest eyesAnd still conclusion, shall acquire no honourDemuring upon me. But come, come, Antony,--Help me, my women,--we must draw thee up:Assist, good friends.

MARK ANTONY

O, quick, or I am gone.

CLEOPATRA

Here's sport indeed! How heavy weighs my lord!Our strength is all gone into heaviness,That makes the weight: had I great Juno's power,The strong-wing'd Mercury should fetch thee up,And set thee by Jove's side. Yet come a little,--Wishes were ever fools,--O, come, come, come;They heave MARK ANTONY aloft to CLEOPATRA
And welcome, welcome! die where thou hast lived:Quicken with kissing: had my lips that power,Thus would I wear them out.

All

A heavy sight!

MARK ANTONY

I am dying, Egypt, dying:Give me some wine, and let me speak a little.

CLEOPATRA

No, let me speak; and let me rail so high,That the false housewife Fortune break her wheel,Provoked by my offence.

MARK ANTONY

One word, sweet queen:Of Caesar seek your honour, with your safety. O!

CLEOPATRA

They do not go together.

MARK ANTONY

Gentle, hear me:None about Caesar trust but Proculeius.

CLEOPATRA

My resolution and my hands I'll trust;None about Caesar.

MARK ANTONY

The miserable change now at my endLament nor sorrow at; but please your thoughtsIn feeding them with those my former fortunesWherein I lived, the greatest prince o' the world,The noblest; and do now not basely die,Not cowardly put off my helmet toMy countryman,--a Roman by a RomanValiantly vanquish'd. Now my spirit is going;I can no more.

CLEOPATRA

                  Noblest of men, woo't die?Hast thou no care of me? shall I abideIn this dull world, which in thy absence isNo better than a sty? O, see, my women,MARK ANTONY dies
The crown o' the earth doth melt. My lord!O, wither'd is the garland of the war,The soldier's pole is fall'n: young boys and girlsAre level now with men; the odds is gone,And there is nothing left remarkableBeneath the visiting moon.Faints


CHARMIAN

O, quietness, lady!

IRAS

She is dead too, our sovereign.

CHARMIAN

Lady!

IRAS

Madam!

CHARMIAN

O madam, madam, madam!

IRAS

Royal Egypt, Empress!

CHARMIAN

Peace, peace, Iras!

CLEOPATRA

No more, but e'en a woman, and commandedBy such poor passion as the maid that milksAnd does the meanest chares. It were for meTo throw my sceptre at the injurious gods;To tell them that this world did equal theirsTill they had stol'n our jewel. All's but naught;Patience is scottish, and impatience doesBecome a dog that's mad: then is it sinTo rush into the secret house of death,Ere death dare come to us? How do you, women?What, what! good cheer! Why, how now, Charmian!My noble girls! Ah, women, women, look,Our lamp is spent, it's out! Good sirs, take heart:We'll bury him; and then, what's brave,what's noble,Let's do it after the high Roman fashion,And make death proud to take us. Come, away:This case of that huge spirit now is cold:Ah, women, women! come; we have no friendBut resolution, and the briefest end.Exeunt; those above bearing off MARK ANTONY's body

ACT V
SCENE I. Alexandria. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's camp.

Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, AGRIPPA, DOLABELLA, MECAENAS, GALLUS, PROCULEIUS, and others, his council of war


OCTAVIUS CAESAR

Go to him, Dolabella, bid him yield;Being so frustrate, tell him he mocksThe pauses that he makes.

DOLABELLA

Caesar, I shall.Exit
Enter DERCETAS, with the sword of MARK ANTONY


OCTAVIUS CAESAR

Wherefore is that? and what art thou that darestAppear thus to us?

DERCETAS

                  I am call'd Dercetas;Mark Antony I served, who best was worthyBest to be served: whilst he stood up and spoke,He was my master; and I wore my lifeTo spend upon his haters. If thou pleaseTo take me to thee, as I was to himI'll be to Caesar; if thou pleasest not,I yield thee up my life.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

What is't thou say'st?

DERCETAS

I say, O Caesar, Antony is dead.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

The breaking of so great a thing should makeA greater crack: the round worldShould have shook lions into civil streets,And citizens to their dens: the death of AntonyIs not a single doom; in the name layA moiety of the world.

DERCETAS

He is dead, Caesar:Not by a public minister of justice,Nor by a hired knife; but that self hand,Which writ his honour in the acts it did,Hath, with the courage which the heart did lend it,Splitted the heart. This is his sword;I robb'd his wound of it; behold it stain'dWith his most noble blood.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

Look you sad, friends?The gods rebuke me, but it is tidingsTo wash the eyes of kings.

AGRIPPA

And strange it is,That nature must compel us to lamentOur most persisted deeds.

MECAENAS

His taints and honoursWaged equal with him.

AGRIPPA

A rarer spirit neverDid steer humanity: but you, gods, will give usSome faults to make us men. Caesar is touch'd.

MECAENAS

When such a spacious mirror's set before him,He needs must see himself.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

O Antony!I have follow'd thee to this; but we do lanceDiseases in our bodies: I must perforceHave shown to thee such a declining day,Or look on thine; we could not stall togetherIn the whole world: but yet let me lament,With tears as sovereign as the blood of hearts,That thou, my brother, my competitorIn top of all design, my mate in empire,Friend and companion in the front of war,The arm of mine own body, and the heartWhere mine his thoughts did kindle,--that our stars,Unreconciliable, should divideOur equalness to this. Hear me, good friends--But I will tell you at some meeter season:Enter an Egyptian
The business of this man looks out of him;We'll hear him what he says. Whence are you?

Egyptian

A poor Egyptian yet. The queen my mistress,Confined in all she has, her monument,Of thy intents desires instruction,That she preparedly may frame herselfTo the way she's forced to.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

Bid her have good heart:She soon shall know of us, by some of ours,How honourable and how kindly weDetermine for her; for Caesar cannot liveTo be ungentle.

Egyptian

So the gods preserve thee!Exit


OCTAVIUS CAESAR

Come hither, Proculeius. Go and say,We purpose her no shame: give her what comfortsThe quality of her passion shall require,Lest, in her greatness, by some mortal strokeShe do defeat us; for her life in RomeWould be eternal in our triumph: go,And with your speediest bring us what she says,And how you find of her.

PROCULEIUS

Caesar, I shall.Exit


OCTAVIUS CAESAR

Gallus, go you along.Exit GALLUS
Where's Dolabella,To second Proculeius?

All

Dolabella!

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

Let him alone, for I remember nowHow he's employ'd: he shall in time be ready.Go with me to my tent; where you shall seeHow hardly I was drawn into this war;How calm and gentle I proceeded stillIn all my writings: go with me, and seeWhat I can show in this.Exeunt

SCENE II. Alexandria. A room in the monument.

Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, and IRAS


CLEOPATRA

My desolation does begin to makeA better life. 'Tis paltry to be Caesar;Not being Fortune, he's but Fortune's knave,A minister of her will: and it is greatTo do that thing that ends all other deeds;Which shackles accidents and bolts up change;Which sleeps, and never palates more the dug,The beggar's nurse and Caesar's.Enter, to the gates of the monument, PROCULEIUS, GALLUS and Soldiers


PROCULEIUS

Caesar sends greeting to the Queen of Egypt;And bids thee study on what fair demandsThou mean'st to have him grant thee.

CLEOPATRA

What's thy name?

PROCULEIUS

My name is Proculeius.

CLEOPATRA

AntonyDid tell me of you, bade me trust you; butI do not greatly care to be deceived,That have no use for trusting. If your masterWould have a queen his beggar, you must tell him,That majesty, to keep decorum, mustNo less beg than a kingdom: if he pleaseTo give me conquer'd Egypt for my son,He gives me so much of mine own, as IWill kneel to him with thanks.

PROCULEIUS

Be of good cheer;You're fall'n into a princely hand, fear nothing:Make your full reference freely to my lord,Who is so full of grace, that it flows overOn all that need: let me report to himYour sweet dependency; and you shall findA conqueror that will pray in aid for kindness,Where he for grace is kneel'd to.

CLEOPATRA

Pray you, tell himI am his fortune's vassal, and I send himThe greatness he has got. I hourly learnA doctrine of obedience; and would gladlyLook him i' the face.

PROCULEIUS

This I'll report, dear lady.Have comfort, for I know your plight is pitiedOf him that caused it.

GALLUS

You see how easily she may be surprised:Here PROCULEIUS and two of the Guard ascend the  monument by a ladder placed against a window, and,  having descended, come behind CLEOPATRA. Some of the Guard unbar and open the gates
To PROCULEIUS and the Guard
Guard her till Caesar come.Exit


IRAS

Royal queen!

CHARMIAN

O Cleopatra! thou art taken, queen:

CLEOPATRA

Quick, quick, good hands.Drawing a dagger


PROCULEIUS

Hold, worthy lady, hold:Seizes and disarms her
Do not yourself such wrong, who are in thisRelieved, but not betray'd.

CLEOPATRA

What, of death too,That rids our dogs of languish?

PROCULEIUS

Cleopatra,Do not abuse my master's bounty byThe undoing of yourself: let the world seeHis nobleness well acted, which your deathWill never let come forth.

CLEOPATRA

Where art thou, death?Come hither, come! come, come, and take a queenWorthy many babes and beggars!

PROCULEIUS

O, temperance, lady!

CLEOPATRA

Sir, I will eat no meat, I'll not drink, sir;If idle talk will once be necessary,I'll not sleep neither: this mortal house I'll ruin,Do Caesar what he can. Know, sir, that IWill not wait pinion'd at your master's court;Nor once be chastised with the sober eyeOf dull Octavia. Shall they hoist me upAnd show me to the shouting varletryOf censuring Rome? Rather a ditch in EgyptBe gentle grave unto me! rather on Nilus' mudLay me stark naked, and let the water-fliesBlow me into abhorring! rather makeMy country's high pyramides my gibbet,And hang me up in chains!

PROCULEIUS

You do extendThese thoughts of horror further than you shallFind cause in Caesar.Enter DOLABELLA


DOLABELLA

Proculeius,What thou hast done thy master Caesar knows,And he hath sent for thee: for the queen,I'll take her to my guard.

PROCULEIUS

So, Dolabella,It shall content me best: be gentle to her.To CLEOPATRA
To Caesar I will speak what you shall please,If you'll employ me to him.

CLEOPATRA

Say, I would die.Exeunt PROCULEIUS and Soldiers


DOLABELLA

Most noble empress, you have heard of me?

CLEOPATRA

I cannot tell.

DOLABELLA

                  Assuredly you know me.

CLEOPATRA

No matter, sir, what I have heard or known.You laugh when boys or women tell their dreams;Is't not your trick?

DOLABELLA

I understand not, madam.

CLEOPATRA

I dream'd there was an Emperor Antony:O, such another sleep, that I might seeBut such another man!

DOLABELLA

If it might please ye,--

CLEOPATRA

His face was as the heavens; and therein stuckA sun and moon, which kept their course,and lightedThe little O, the earth.

DOLABELLA

Most sovereign creature,--

CLEOPATRA

His legs bestrid the ocean: his rear'd armCrested the world: his voice was propertiedAs all the tuned spheres, and that to friends;But when he meant to quail and shake the orb,He was as rattling thunder. For his bounty,There was no winter in't; an autumn 'twasThat grew the more by reaping: his delightsWere dolphin-like; they show'd his back aboveThe element they lived in: in his liveryWalk'd crowns and crownets; realms and islands wereAs plates dropp'd from his pocket.

DOLABELLA

Cleopatra!

CLEOPATRA

Think you there was, or might be, such a manAs this I dream'd of?

DOLABELLA

Gentle madam, no.

CLEOPATRA

You lie, up to the hearing of the gods.But, if there be, or ever were, one such,It's past the size of dreaming: nature wants stuffTo vie strange forms with fancy; yet, to imagineAnd Antony, were nature's piece 'gainst fancy,Condemning shadows quite.

DOLABELLA

Hear me, good madam.Your loss is as yourself, great; and you bear itAs answering to the weight: would I might neverO'ertake pursued success, but I do feel,By the rebound of yours, a grief that smitesMy very heart at root.

CLEOPATRA

I thank you, sir,Know you what Caesar means to do with me?

DOLABELLA

I am loath to tell you what I would you knew.

CLEOPATRA

Nay, pray you, sir,--

DOLABELLA

Though he be honourable,--

CLEOPATRA

He'll lead me, then, in triumph?

DOLABELLA

Madam, he will; I know't.Flourish, and shout within, 'Make way there: Octavius Caesar!'
Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, GALLUS, PROCULEIUS, MECAENAS, SELEUCUS, and others of his Train


OCTAVIUS CAESAR

Which is the Queen of Egypt?

DOLABELLA

It is the emperor, madam.CLEOPATRA kneels


OCTAVIUS CAESAR

Arise, you shall not kneel:I pray you, rise; rise, Egypt.

CLEOPATRA

Sir, the godsWill have it thus; my master and my lordI must obey.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

                  Take to you no hard thoughts:The record of what injuries you did us,Though written in our flesh, we shall rememberAs things but done by chance.

CLEOPATRA

Sole sir o' the world,I cannot project mine own cause so wellTo make it clear; but do confess I haveBeen laden with like frailties which beforeHave often shamed our sex.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

Cleopatra, know,We will extenuate rather than enforce:If you apply yourself to our intents,Which towards you are most gentle, you shall findA benefit in this change; but if you seekTo lay on me a cruelty, by takingAntony's course, you shall bereave yourselfOf my good purposes, and put your childrenTo that destruction which I'll guard them from,If thereon you rely. I'll take my leave.

CLEOPATRA

And may, through all the world: 'tis yours; and we,Your scutcheons and your signs of conquest, shallHang in what place you please. Here, my good lord.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

You shall advise me in all for Cleopatra.

CLEOPATRA

This is the brief of money, plate, and jewels,I am possess'd of: 'tis exactly valued;Not petty things admitted. Where's Seleucus?

SELEUCUS

Here, madam.

CLEOPATRA

This is my treasurer: let him speak, my lord,Upon his peril, that I have reservedTo myself nothing. Speak the truth, Seleucus.

SELEUCUS

Madam,I had rather seal my lips, than, to my peril,Speak that which is not.

CLEOPATRA

What have I kept back?

SELEUCUS

Enough to purchase what you have made known.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

Nay, blush not, Cleopatra; I approveYour wisdom in the deed.

CLEOPATRA

See, Caesar! O, behold,How pomp is follow'd! mine will now be yours;And, should we shift estates, yours would be mine.The ingratitude of this Seleucus doesEven make me wild: O slave, of no more trustThan love that's hired! What, goest thou back? thou shaltGo back, I warrant thee; but I'll catch thine eyes,Though they had wings: slave, soulless villain, dog!O rarely base!

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

                  Good queen, let us entreat you.

CLEOPATRA

O Caesar, what a wounding shame is this,That thou, vouchsafing here to visit me,Doing the honour of thy lordlinessTo one so meek, that mine own servant shouldParcel the sum of my disgraces byAddition of his envy! Say, good Caesar,That I some lady trifles have reserved,Immoment toys, things of such dignityAs we greet modern friends withal; and say,Some nobler token I have kept apartFor Livia and Octavia, to induceTheir mediation; must I be unfoldedWith one that I have bred? The gods! it smites meBeneath the fall I have.To SELEUCUS
Prithee, go hence;Or I shall show the cinders of my spiritsThrough the ashes of my chance: wert thou a man,Thou wouldst have mercy on me.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

Forbear, Seleucus.Exit SELEUCUS


CLEOPATRA

Be it known, that we, the greatest, are misthoughtFor things that others do; and, when we fall,We answer others' merits in our name,Are therefore to be pitied.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

Cleopatra,Not what you have reserved, nor what acknowledged,Put we i' the roll of conquest: still be't yours,Bestow it at your pleasure; and believe,Caesar's no merchant, to make prize with youOf things that merchants sold. Therefore be cheer'd;Make not your thoughts your prisons: no, dear queen;For we intend so to dispose you asYourself shall give us counsel. Feed, and sleep:Our care and pity is so much upon you,That we remain your friend; and so, adieu.

CLEOPATRA

My master, and my lord!

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

Not so. Adieu.Flourish. Exeunt OCTAVIUS CAESAR and his train


CLEOPATRA

He words me, girls, he words me, that I should notBe noble to myself: but, hark thee, Charmian.Whispers CHARMIAN


IRAS

Finish, good lady; the bright day is done,And we are for the dark.

CLEOPATRA

Hie thee again:I have spoke already, and it is provided;Go put it to the haste.

CHARMIAN

Madam, I will.Re-enter DOLABELLA


DOLABELLA

Where is the queen?

CHARMIAN

Behold, sir.Exit


CLEOPATRA

Dolabella!

DOLABELLA

Madam, as thereto sworn by your command,Which my love makes religion to obey,I tell you this: Caesar through SyriaIntends his journey; and within three daysYou with your children will he send before:Make your best use of this: I have perform'dYour pleasure and my promise.

CLEOPATRA

Dolabella,I shall remain your debtor.

DOLABELLA

I your servant,Adieu, good queen; I must attend on Caesar.

CLEOPATRA

Farewell, and thanks.Exit DOLABELLA
Now, Iras, what think'st thou?Thou, an Egyptian puppet, shalt be shownIn Rome, as well as I	mechanic slavesWith greasy aprons, rules, and hammers, shallUplift us to the view; in their thick breaths,Rank of gross diet, shall be enclouded,And forced to drink their vapour.

IRAS

The gods forbid!

CLEOPATRA

Nay, 'tis most certain, Iras: saucy lictorsWill catch at us, like strumpets; and scald rhymersBallad us out o' tune: the quick comediansExtemporally will stage us, and presentOur Alexandrian revels; AntonyShall be brought drunken forth, and I shall seeSome squeaking Cleopatra boy my greatnessI' the posture of a whore.

IRAS

O the good gods!

CLEOPATRA

Nay, that's certain.

IRAS

I'll never see 't; for, I am sure, my nailsAre stronger than mine eyes.

CLEOPATRA

Why, that's the wayTo fool their preparation, and to conquerTheir most absurd intents.Re-enter CHARMIAN
Now, Charmian!Show me, my women, like a queen: go fetchMy best attires: I am again for Cydnus,To meet Mark Antony: sirrah Iras, go.Now, noble Charmian, we'll dispatch indeed;And, when thou hast done this chare, I'll give thee leaveTo play till doomsday. Bring our crown and all.Wherefore's this noise?Exit IRAS. A noise within
Enter a Guardsman


Guard

Here is a rural fellowThat will not be denied your highness presence:He brings you figs.

CLEOPATRA

Let him come in.Exit Guardsman
What poor an instrumentMay do a noble deed! he brings me liberty.My resolution's placed, and I have nothingOf woman in me: now from head to footI am marble-constant; now the fleeting moonNo planet is of mine.Re-enter Guardsman, with Clown bringing in a basket


Guard

This is the man.

CLEOPATRA

Avoid, and leave him.Exit Guardsman
Hast thou the pretty worm of Nilus there,That kills and pains not?

Clown

Truly, I have him: but I would not be the partythat should desire you to touch him, for his bitingis immortal; those that do die of it do seldom ornever recover.

CLEOPATRA

Rememberest thou any that have died on't?

Clown

Very many, men and women too. I heard of one ofthem no longer than yesterday: a very honest woman,but something given to lie; as a woman should notdo, but in the way of honesty: how she died of thebiting of it, what pain she felt: truly, she makesa very good report o' the worm; but he that willbelieve all that they say, shall never be saved byhalf that they do: but this is most fallible, theworm's an odd worm.

CLEOPATRA

Get thee hence; farewell.

Clown

I wish you all joy of the worm.Setting down his basket


CLEOPATRA

Farewell.

Clown

You must think this, look you, that the worm willdo his kind.

CLEOPATRA

Ay, ay; farewell.

Clown

Look you, the worm is not to be trusted but in thekeeping of wise people; for, indeed, there is nogoodness in worm.

CLEOPATRA

Take thou no care; it shall be heeded.

Clown

Very good. Give it nothing, I pray you, for it isnot worth the feeding.

CLEOPATRA

Will it eat me?

Clown

You must not think I am so simple but I know thedevil himself will not eat a woman: I know that awoman is a dish for the gods, if the devil dress hernot. But, truly, these same whoreson devils do thegods great harm in their women; for in every tenthat they make, the devils mar five.

CLEOPATRA

Well, get thee gone; farewell.

Clown

Yes, forsooth: I wish you joy o' the worm.Exit
Re-enter IRAS with a robe, crown,  & c


CLEOPATRA

Give me my robe, put on my crown; I haveImmortal longings in me: now no moreThe juice of Egypt's grape shall moist this lip:Yare, yare, good Iras; quick. Methinks I hearAntony call; I see him rouse himselfTo praise my noble act; I hear him mockThe luck of Caesar, which the gods give menTo excuse their after wrath: husband, I come:Now to that name my courage prove my title!I am fire and air; my other elementsI give to baser life. So; have you done?Come then, and take the last warmth of my lips.Farewell, kind Charmian; Iras, long farewell.Kisses them. IRAS falls and dies
Have I the aspic in my lips? Dost fall?If thou and nature can so gently part,The stroke of death is as a lover's pinch,Which hurts, and is desired. Dost thou lie still?If thus thou vanishest, thou tell'st the worldIt is not worth leave-taking.

CHARMIAN

Dissolve, thick cloud, and rain; that I may say,The gods themselves do weep!

CLEOPATRA

This proves me base:If she first meet the curled Antony,He'll make demand of her, and spend that kissWhich is my heaven to have. Come, thoumortal wretch,To an asp, which she applies to her breast
With thy sharp teeth this knot intrinsicateOf life at once untie: poor venomous foolBe angry, and dispatch. O, couldst thou speak,That I might hear thee call great Caesar assUnpolicied!

CHARMIAN

          O eastern star!

CLEOPATRA

Peace, peace!Dost thou not see my baby at my breast,That sucks the nurse asleep?

CHARMIAN

O, break! O, break!

CLEOPATRA

As sweet as balm, as soft as air, as gentle,--O Antony!--Nay, I will take thee too.Applying another asp to her arm
What should I stay--Dies


CHARMIAN

In this vile world? So, fare thee well.Now boast thee, death, in thy possession liesA lass unparallel'd. Downy windows, close;And golden Phoebus never be beheldOf eyes again so royal! Your crown's awry;I'll mend it, and then play.Enter the Guard, rushing in


First Guard

Where is the queen?

CHARMIAN

Speak softly, wake her not.

First Guard

Caesar hath sent--

CHARMIAN

                  Too slow a messenger.Applies an asp
O, come apace, dispatch! I partly feel thee.

First Guard

Approach, ho! All's not well: Caesar's beguiled.

Second Guard

There's Dolabella sent from Caesar; call him.

First Guard

What work is here! Charmian, is this well done?

CHARMIAN

It is well done, and fitting for a princessDescended of so many royal kings.Ah, soldier!Dies
Re-enter DOLABELLA


DOLABELLA

How goes it here?

Second Guard

                  All dead.

DOLABELLA

Caesar, thy thoughtsTouch their effects in this: thyself art comingTo see perform'd the dreaded act which thouSo sought'st to hinder.Within  'A way there, a way for Caesar!'
Re-enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR and all his train marching


DOLABELLA

O sir, you are too sure an augurer;That you did fear is done.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

Bravest at the last,She levell'd at our purposes, and, being royal,Took her own way. The manner of their deaths?I do not see them bleed.

DOLABELLA

Who was last with them?

First Guard

A simple countryman, that brought her figs:This was his basket.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

Poison'd, then.

First Guard

O Caesar,This Charmian lived but now; she stood and spake:I found her trimming up the diademOn her dead mistress; tremblingly she stoodAnd on the sudden dropp'd.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

O noble weakness!If they had swallow'd poison, 'twould appearBy external swelling: but she looks like sleep,As she would catch another AntonyIn her strong toil of grace.

DOLABELLA

Here, on her breast,There is a vent of blood and something blown:The like is on her arm.

First Guard

This is an aspic's trail: and these fig-leavesHave slime upon them, such as the aspic leavesUpon the caves of Nile.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

Most probableThat so she died; for her physician tells meShe hath pursued conclusions infiniteOf easy ways to die. Take up her bed;And bear her women from the monument:She shall be buried by her Antony:No grave upon the earth shall clip in itA pair so famous. High events as theseStrike those that make them; and their story isNo less in pity than his glory whichBrought them to be lamented. Our army shallIn solemn show attend this funeral;And then to Rome. Come, Dolabella, seeHigh order in this great solemnity.Exeunt
