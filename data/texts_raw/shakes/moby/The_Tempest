ACT I
SCENE I. On a ship at sea: a tempestuous noise

of thunder and lightning heard.Enter a Master and a Boatswain


Master

Boatswain!

Boatswain

Here, master: what cheer?

Master

Good, speak to the mariners: fall to't, yarely,or we run ourselves aground: bestir, bestir.Exit
Enter Mariners


Boatswain

Heigh, my hearts! cheerly, cheerly, my hearts!yare, yare! Take in the topsail. Tend to themaster's whistle. Blow, till thou burst thy wind,if room enough!Enter ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, FERDINAND, GONZALO, and others


ALONSO

Good boatswain, have care. Where's the master?Play the men.

Boatswain

I pray now, keep below.

ANTONIO

Where is the master, boatswain?

Boatswain

Do you not hear him? You mar our labour: keep yourcabins: you do assist the storm.

GONZALO

Nay, good, be patient.

Boatswain

When the sea is. Hence! What cares these roarersfor the name of king? To cabin: silence! trouble us not.

GONZALO

Good, yet remember whom thou hast aboard.

Boatswain

None that I more love than myself. You are acounsellor; if you can command these elements tosilence, and work the peace of the present, we willnot hand a rope more; use your authority: if youcannot, give thanks you have lived so long, and makeyourself ready in your cabin for the mischance ofthe hour, if it so hap. Cheerly, good hearts! Outof our way, I say.Exit


GONZALO

I have great comfort from this fellow: methinks hehath no drowning mark upon him; his complexion isperfect gallows. Stand fast, good Fate, to hishanging: make the rope of his destiny our cable,for our own doth little advantage. If he be notborn to be hanged, our case is miserable.Exeunt
Re-enter Boatswain


Boatswain

Down with the topmast! yare! lower, lower! Bringher to try with main-course.A cry within
A plague upon this howling! they are louder thanthe weather or our office.Re-enter SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, and GONZALO
Yet again! what do you here? Shall we give o'erand drown? Have you a mind to sink?

SEBASTIAN

A pox o' your throat, you bawling, blasphemous,incharitable dog!

Boatswain

Work you then.

ANTONIO

Hang, cur! hang, you whoreson, insolent noisemaker!We are less afraid to be drowned than thou art.

GONZALO

I'll warrant him for drowning; though the ship wereno stronger than a nutshell and as leaky as anunstanched wench.

Boatswain

Lay her a-hold, a-hold! set her two courses off tosea again; lay her off.Enter Mariners wet


Mariners

All lost! to prayers, to prayers! all lost!

Boatswain

What, must our mouths be cold?

GONZALO

The king and prince at prayers! let's assist them,For our case is as theirs.

SEBASTIAN

I'm out of patience.

ANTONIO

We are merely cheated of our lives by drunkards:This wide-chapp'd rascal--would thou mightst lie drowningThe washing of ten tides!

GONZALO

He'll be hang'd yet,Though every drop of water swear against itAnd gape at widest to glut him.A confused noise within:   'Mercy on us!'--  'We split, we split!'--'Farewell, my wife and  children!'-- 'Farewell, brother!'--'We split, we split, we split!'


ANTONIO

Let's all sink with the king.

SEBASTIAN

Let's take leave of him.Exeunt ANTONIO and SEBASTIAN


GONZALO

Now would I give a thousand furlongs of sea for anacre of barren ground, long heath, brown furze, anything. The wills above be done! but I would faindie a dry death.Exeunt

SCENE II. The island. Before PROSPERO'S cell.

Enter PROSPERO and MIRANDA


MIRANDA

If by your art, my dearest father, you havePut the wild waters in this roar, allay them.The sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch,But that the sea, mounting to the welkin's cheek,Dashes the fire out. O, I have sufferedWith those that I saw suffer: a brave vessel,Who had, no doubt, some noble creature in her,Dash'd all to pieces. O, the cry did knockAgainst my very heart. Poor souls, they perish'd.Had I been any god of power, I wouldHave sunk the sea within the earth or ereIt should the good ship so have swallow'd andThe fraughting souls within her.

PROSPERO

Be collected:No more amazement: tell your piteous heartThere's no harm done.

MIRANDA

O, woe the day!

PROSPERO

No harm.I have done nothing but in care of thee,Of thee, my dear one, thee, my daughter, whoArt ignorant of what thou art, nought knowingOf whence I am, nor that I am more betterThan Prospero, master of a full poor cell,And thy no greater father.

MIRANDA

More to knowDid never meddle with my thoughts.

PROSPERO

'Tis timeI should inform thee farther. Lend thy hand,And pluck my magic garment from me. So:Lays down his mantle
Lie there, my art. Wipe thou thine eyes; have comfort.The direful spectacle of the wreck, which touch'dThe very virtue of compassion in thee,I have with such provision in mine artSo safely ordered that there is no soul--No, not so much perdition as an hairBetid to any creature in the vesselWhich thou heard'st cry, which thou saw'st sink. Sit down;For thou must now know farther.

MIRANDA

You have oftenBegun to tell me what I am, but stopp'dAnd left me to a bootless inquisition,Concluding 'Stay: not yet.'

PROSPERO

The hour's now come;The very minute bids thee ope thine ear;Obey and be attentive. Canst thou rememberA time before we came unto this cell?I do not think thou canst, for then thou wast notOut three years old.

MIRANDA

Certainly, sir, I can.

PROSPERO

By what? by any other house or person?Of any thing the image tell me thatHath kept with thy remembrance.

MIRANDA

'Tis far offAnd rather like a dream than an assuranceThat my remembrance warrants. Had I notFour or five women once that tended me?

PROSPERO

Thou hadst, and more, Miranda. But how is itThat this lives in thy mind? What seest thou elseIn the dark backward and abysm of time?If thou remember'st aught ere thou camest here,How thou camest here thou mayst.

MIRANDA

But that I do not.

PROSPERO

Twelve year since, Miranda, twelve year since,Thy father was the Duke of Milan andA prince of power.

MIRANDA

                  Sir, are not you my father?

PROSPERO

Thy mother was a piece of virtue, andShe said thou wast my daughter; and thy fatherWas Duke of Milan; and thou his only heirAnd princess no worse issued.

MIRANDA

O the heavens!What foul play had we, that we came from thence?Or blessed was't we did?

PROSPERO

Both, both, my girl:By foul play, as thou say'st, were we heaved thence,But blessedly holp hither.

MIRANDA

O, my heart bleedsTo think o' the teen that I have turn'd you to,Which is from my remembrance! Please you, farther.

PROSPERO

My brother and thy uncle, call'd Antonio--I pray thee, mark me--that a brother shouldBe so perfidious!--he whom next thyselfOf all the world I loved and to him putThe manage of my state; as at that timeThrough all the signories it was the firstAnd Prospero the prime duke, being so reputedIn dignity, and for the liberal artsWithout a parallel; those being all my study,The government I cast upon my brotherAnd to my state grew stranger, being transportedAnd rapt in secret studies. Thy false uncle--Dost thou attend me?

MIRANDA

Sir, most heedfully.

PROSPERO

Being once perfected how to grant suits,How to deny them, who to advance and whoTo trash for over-topping, new createdThe creatures that were mine, I say, or changed 'em,Or else new form'd 'em; having both the keyOf officer and office, set all hearts i' the stateTo what tune pleased his ear; that now he wasThe ivy which had hid my princely trunk,And suck'd my verdure out on't. Thou attend'st not.

MIRANDA

O, good sir, I do.

PROSPERO

                  I pray thee, mark me.I, thus neglecting worldly ends, all dedicatedTo closeness and the bettering of my mindWith that which, but by being so retired,O'er-prized all popular rate, in my false brotherAwaked an evil nature; and my trust,Like a good parent, did beget of himA falsehood in its contrary as greatAs my trust was; which had indeed no limit,A confidence sans bound. He being thus lorded,Not only with what my revenue yielded,But what my power might else exact, like oneWho having into truth, by telling of it,Made such a sinner of his memory,To credit his own lie, he did believeHe was indeed the duke; out o' the substitutionAnd executing the outward face of royalty,With all prerogative: hence his ambition growing--Dost thou hear?

MIRANDA

                  Your tale, sir, would cure deafness.

PROSPERO

To have no screen between this part he play'dAnd him he play'd it for, he needs will beAbsolute Milan. Me, poor man, my libraryWas dukedom large enough: of temporal royaltiesHe thinks me now incapable; confederates--So dry he was for sway--wi' the King of NaplesTo give him annual tribute, do him homage,Subject his coronet to his crown and bendThe dukedom yet unbow'd--alas, poor Milan!--To most ignoble stooping.

MIRANDA

O the heavens!

PROSPERO

Mark his condition and the event; then tell meIf this might be a brother.

MIRANDA

I should sinTo think but nobly of my grandmother:Good wombs have borne bad sons.

PROSPERO

Now the condition.The King of Naples, being an enemyTo me inveterate, hearkens my brother's suit;Which was, that he, in lieu o' the premisesOf homage and I know not how much tribute,Should presently extirpate me and mineOut of the dukedom and confer fair MilanWith all the honours on my brother: whereon,A treacherous army levied, one midnightFated to the purpose did Antonio openThe gates of Milan, and, i' the dead of darkness,The ministers for the purpose hurried thenceMe and thy crying self.

MIRANDA

Alack, for pity!I, not remembering how I cried out then,Will cry it o'er again: it is a hintThat wrings mine eyes to't.

PROSPERO

Hear a little furtherAnd then I'll bring thee to the present businessWhich now's upon's; without the which this storyWere most impertinent.

MIRANDA

Wherefore did they notThat hour destroy us?

PROSPERO

Well demanded, wench:My tale provokes that question. Dear, they durst not,So dear the love my people bore me, nor setA mark so bloody on the business, butWith colours fairer painted their foul ends.In few, they hurried us aboard a bark,Bore us some leagues to sea; where they preparedA rotten carcass of a boat, not rigg'd,Nor tackle, sail, nor mast; the very ratsInstinctively had quit it: there they hoist us,To cry to the sea that roar'd to us, to sighTo the winds whose pity, sighing back again,Did us but loving wrong.

MIRANDA

Alack, what troubleWas I then to you!

PROSPERO

                  O, a cherubimThou wast that did preserve me. Thou didst smile.Infused with a fortitude from heaven,When I have deck'd the sea with drops full salt,Under my burthen groan'd; which raised in meAn undergoing stomach, to bear upAgainst what should ensue.

MIRANDA

How came we ashore?

PROSPERO

By Providence divine.Some food we had and some fresh water thatA noble Neapolitan, Gonzalo,Out of his charity, being then appointedMaster of this design, did give us, withRich garments, linens, stuffs and necessaries,Which since have steaded much; so, of his gentleness,Knowing I loved my books, he furnish'd meFrom mine own library with volumes thatI prize above my dukedom.

MIRANDA

Would I mightBut ever see that man!

PROSPERO

Now I arise:Resumes his mantle
Sit still, and hear the last of our sea-sorrow.Here in this island we arrived; and hereHave I, thy schoolmaster, made thee more profitThan other princesses can that have more timeFor vainer hours and tutors not so careful.

MIRANDA

Heavens thank you for't! And now, I pray you, sir,For still 'tis beating in my mind, your reasonFor raising this sea-storm?

PROSPERO

Know thus far forth.By accident most strange, bountiful Fortune,Now my dear lady, hath mine enemiesBrought to this shore; and by my prescienceI find my zenith doth depend uponA most auspicious star, whose influenceIf now I court not but omit, my fortunesWill ever after droop. Here cease more questions:Thou art inclined to sleep; 'tis a good dulness,And give it way: I know thou canst not choose.MIRANDA sleeps
Come away, servant, come. I am ready now.Approach, my Ariel, come.Enter ARIEL


ARIEL

All hail, great master! grave sir, hail! I comeTo answer thy best pleasure; be't to fly,To swim, to dive into the fire, to rideOn the curl'd clouds, to thy strong bidding taskAriel and all his quality.

PROSPERO

Hast thou, spirit,Perform'd to point the tempest that I bade thee?

ARIEL

To every article.I boarded the king's ship; now on the beak,Now in the waist, the deck, in every cabin,I flamed amazement: sometime I'ld divide,And burn in many places; on the topmast,The yards and bowsprit, would I flame distinctly,Then meet and join. Jove's lightnings, the precursorsO' the dreadful thunder-claps, more momentaryAnd sight-outrunning were not; the fire and cracksOf sulphurous roaring the most mighty NeptuneSeem to besiege and make his bold waves tremble,Yea, his dread trident shake.

PROSPERO

My brave spirit!Who was so firm, so constant, that this coilWould not infect his reason?

ARIEL

Not a soulBut felt a fever of the mad and play'dSome tricks of desperation. All but marinersPlunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel,Then all afire with me: the king's son, Ferdinand,With hair up-staring,--then like reeds, not hair,--Was the first man that leap'd; cried, 'Hell is emptyAnd all the devils are here.'

PROSPERO

Why that's my spirit!But was not this nigh shore?

ARIEL

Close by, my master.

PROSPERO

But are they, Ariel, safe?

ARIEL

Not a hair perish'd;On their sustaining garments not a blemish,But fresher than before: and, as thou badest me,In troops I have dispersed them 'bout the isle.The king's son have I landed by himself;Whom I left cooling of the air with sighsIn an odd angle of the isle and sitting,His arms in this sad knot.

PROSPERO

Of the king's shipThe mariners say how thou hast disposedAnd all the rest o' the fleet.

ARIEL

Safely in harbourIs the king's ship; in the deep nook, where onceThou call'dst me up at midnight to fetch dewFrom the still-vex'd Bermoothes, there she's hid:The mariners all under hatches stow'd;Who, with a charm join'd to their suffer'd labour,I have left asleep; and for the rest o' the fleetWhich I dispersed, they all have met againAnd are upon the Mediterranean flote,Bound sadly home for Naples,Supposing that they saw the king's ship wreck'dAnd his great person perish.

PROSPERO

Ariel, thy chargeExactly is perform'd: but there's more work.What is the time o' the day?

ARIEL

Past the mid season.

PROSPERO

At least two glasses. The time 'twixt six and nowMust by us both be spent most preciously.

ARIEL

Is there more toil? Since thou dost give me pains,Let me remember thee what thou hast promised,Which is not yet perform'd me.

PROSPERO

How now? moody?What is't thou canst demand?

ARIEL

My liberty.

PROSPERO

Before the time be out? no more!

ARIEL

I prithee,Remember I have done thee worthy service;Told thee no lies, made thee no mistakings, servedWithout or grudge or grumblings: thou didst promiseTo bate me a full year.

PROSPERO

Dost thou forgetFrom what a torment I did free thee?

ARIEL

No.

PROSPERO

Thou dost, and think'st it much to tread the oozeOf the salt deep,To run upon the sharp wind of the north,To do me business in the veins o' the earthWhen it is baked with frost.

ARIEL

I do not, sir.

PROSPERO

Thou liest, malignant thing! Hast thou forgotThe foul witch Sycorax, who with age and envyWas grown into a hoop? hast thou forgot her?

ARIEL

No, sir.

PROSPERO

     Thou hast. Where was she born? speak; tell me.

ARIEL

Sir, in Argier.

PROSPERO

                  O, was she so? I mustOnce in a month recount what thou hast been,Which thou forget'st. This damn'd witch Sycorax,For mischiefs manifold and sorceries terribleTo enter human hearing, from Argier,Thou know'st, was banish'd: for one thing she didThey would not take her life. Is not this true?

ARIEL

Ay, sir.

PROSPERO

This blue-eyed hag was hither brought with childAnd here was left by the sailors. Thou, my slave,As thou report'st thyself, wast then her servant;And, for thou wast a spirit too delicateTo act her earthy and abhorr'd commands,Refusing her grand hests, she did confine thee,By help of her more potent ministersAnd in her most unmitigable rage,Into a cloven pine; within which riftImprison'd thou didst painfully remainA dozen years; within which space she diedAnd left thee there; where thou didst vent thy groansAs fast as mill-wheels strike. Then was this island--Save for the son that she did litter here,A freckled whelp hag-born--not honour'd withA human shape.

ARIEL

                  Yes, Caliban her son.

PROSPERO

Dull thing, I say so; he, that CalibanWhom now I keep in service. Thou best know'stWhat torment I did find thee in; thy groansDid make wolves howl and penetrate the breastsOf ever angry bears: it was a tormentTo lay upon the damn'd, which SycoraxCould not again undo: it was mine art,When I arrived and heard thee, that made gapeThe pine and let thee out.

ARIEL

I thank thee, master.

PROSPERO

If thou more murmur'st, I will rend an oakAnd peg thee in his knotty entrails tillThou hast howl'd away twelve winters.

ARIEL

Pardon, master;I will be correspondent to commandAnd do my spiriting gently.

PROSPERO

Do so, and after two daysI will discharge thee.

ARIEL

That's my noble master!What shall I do? say what; what shall I do?

PROSPERO

Go make thyself like a nymph o' the sea: be subjectTo no sight but thine and mine, invisibleTo every eyeball else. Go take this shapeAnd hither come in't: go, hence with diligence!Exit ARIEL
Awake, dear heart, awake! thou hast slept well; Awake!

MIRANDA

     The strangeness of your story putHeaviness in me.

PROSPERO

                  Shake it off. Come on;We'll visit Caliban my slave, who neverYields us kind answer.

MIRANDA

'Tis a villain, sir,I do not love to look on.

PROSPERO

But, as 'tis,We cannot miss him: he does make our fire,Fetch in our wood and serves in officesThat profit us. What, ho! slave! Caliban!Thou earth, thou! speak.

CALIBAN

[Within]  There's wood enough within.

PROSPERO

Come forth, I say! there's other business for thee:Come, thou tortoise! when?Re-enter ARIEL like a water-nymph
Fine apparition! My quaint Ariel,Hark in thine ear.

ARIEL

                  My lord it shall be done.Exit


PROSPERO

Thou poisonous slave, got by the devil himselfUpon thy wicked dam, come forth!Enter CALIBAN


CALIBAN

As wicked dew as e'er my mother brush'dWith raven's feather from unwholesome fenDrop on you both! a south-west blow on yeAnd blister you all o'er!

PROSPERO

For this, be sure, to-night thou shalt have cramps,Side-stitches that shall pen thy breath up; urchinsShall, for that vast of night that they may work,All exercise on thee; thou shalt be pinch'dAs thick as honeycomb, each pinch more stingingThan bees that made 'em.

CALIBAN

I must eat my dinner.This island's mine, by Sycorax my mother,Which thou takest from me. When thou camest first,Thou strokedst me and madest much of me, wouldst give meWater with berries in't, and teach me howTo name the bigger light, and how the less,That burn by day and night: and then I loved theeAnd show'd thee all the qualities o' the isle,The fresh springs, brine-pits, barren place and fertile:Cursed be I that did so! All the charmsOf Sycorax, toads, beetles, bats, light on you!For I am all the subjects that you have,Which first was mine own king: and here you sty meIn this hard rock, whiles you do keep from meThe rest o' the island.

PROSPERO

Thou most lying slave,Whom stripes may move, not kindness! I have used thee,Filth as thou art, with human care, and lodged theeIn mine own cell, till thou didst seek to violateThe honour of my child.

CALIBAN

O ho, O ho! would't had been done!Thou didst prevent me; I had peopled elseThis isle with Calibans.

PROSPERO

Abhorred slave,Which any print of goodness wilt not take,Being capable of all ill! I pitied thee,Took pains to make thee speak, taught thee each hourOne thing or other: when thou didst not, savage,Know thine own meaning, but wouldst gabble likeA thing most brutish, I endow'd thy purposesWith words that made them known. But thy vile race,Though thou didst learn, had that in't whichgood naturesCould not abide to be with; therefore wast thouDeservedly confined into this rock,Who hadst deserved more than a prison.

CALIBAN

You taught me language; and my profit on'tIs, I know how to curse. The red plague rid youFor learning me your language!

PROSPERO

Hag-seed, hence!Fetch us in fuel; and be quick, thou'rt best,To answer other business. Shrug'st thou, malice?If thou neglect'st or dost unwillinglyWhat I command, I'll rack thee with old cramps,Fill all thy bones with aches, make thee roarThat beasts shall tremble at thy din.

CALIBAN

No, pray thee.Aside
I must obey: his art is of such power,It would control my dam's god, Setebos,and make a vassal of him.

PROSPERO

So, slave; hence!Exit CALIBAN
Re-enter ARIEL, invisible, playing and singing; FERDINAND following
ARIEL'S song.Come unto these yellow sands,And then take hands:Courtsied when you have and kiss'dThe wild waves whist,Foot it featly here and there;And, sweet sprites, the burthen bear.Hark, hark!Burthen [dispersedly, within
The watch-dogs bark!Burthen Bow-wow
Hark, hark! I hearThe strain of strutting chanticleerCry, Cock-a-diddle-dow.

FERDINAND

Where should this music be? i' the air or the earth?It sounds no more: and sure, it waits uponSome god o' the island. Sitting on a bank,Weeping again the king my father's wreck,This music crept by me upon the waters,Allaying both their fury and my passionWith its sweet air: thence I have follow'd it,Or it hath drawn me rather. But 'tis gone.No, it begins again.ARIEL sings
Full fathom five thy father lies;Of his bones are coral made;Those are pearls that were his eyes:Nothing of him that doth fadeBut doth suffer a sea-changeInto something rich and strange.Sea-nymphs hourly ring his knellBurthen Ding-dong
Hark! now I hear them,--Ding-dong, bell.

FERDINAND

The ditty does remember my drown'd father.This is no mortal business, nor no soundThat the earth owes. I hear it now above me.

PROSPERO

The fringed curtains of thine eye advanceAnd say what thou seest yond.

MIRANDA

What is't? a spirit?Lord, how it looks about! Believe me, sir,It carries a brave form. But 'tis a spirit.

PROSPERO

No, wench; it eats and sleeps and hath such sensesAs we have, such. This gallant which thou seestWas in the wreck; and, but he's something stain'dWith grief that's beauty's canker, thou mightst call himA goodly person: he hath lost his fellowsAnd strays about to find 'em.

MIRANDA

I might call himA thing divine, for nothing naturalI ever saw so noble.

PROSPERO

[Aside] It goes on, I see,As my soul prompts it. Spirit, fine spirit! I'll free theeWithin two days for this.

FERDINAND

Most sure, the goddessOn whom these airs attend! Vouchsafe my prayerMay know if you remain upon this island;And that you will some good instruction giveHow I may bear me here: my prime request,Which I do last pronounce, is, O you wonder!If you be maid or no?

MIRANDA

No wonder, sir;But certainly a maid.

FERDINAND

My language! heavens!I am the best of them that speak this speech,Were I but where 'tis spoken.

PROSPERO

How? the best?What wert thou, if the King of Naples heard thee?

FERDINAND

A single thing, as I am now, that wondersTo hear thee speak of Naples. He does hear me;And that he does I weep: myself am Naples,Who with mine eyes, never since at ebb, beheldThe king my father wreck'd.

MIRANDA

Alack, for mercy!

FERDINAND

Yes, faith, and all his lords; the Duke of MilanAnd his brave son being twain.

PROSPERO

[Aside]	The Duke of MilanAnd his more braver daughter could control thee,If now 'twere fit to do't. At the first sightThey have changed eyes. Delicate Ariel,I'll set thee free for this.To FERDINAND
A word, good sir;I fear you have done yourself some wrong: a word.

MIRANDA

Why speaks my father so ungently? ThisIs the third man that e'er I saw, the firstThat e'er I sigh'd for: pity move my fatherTo be inclined my way!

FERDINAND

O, if a virgin,And your affection not gone forth, I'll make youThe queen of Naples.

PROSPERO

Soft, sir! one word more.Aside
They are both in either's powers; but this swift businessI must uneasy make, lest too light winningMake the prize light.To FERDINAND
One word more; I charge theeThat thou attend me: thou dost here usurpThe name thou owest not; and hast put thyselfUpon this island as a spy, to win itFrom me, the lord on't.

FERDINAND

No, as I am a man.

MIRANDA

There's nothing ill can dwell in such a temple:If the ill spirit have so fair a house,Good things will strive to dwell with't.

PROSPERO

Follow me.Speak not you for him; he's a traitor. Come;I'll manacle thy neck and feet together:Sea-water shalt thou drink; thy food shall beThe fresh-brook muscles, wither'd roots and husksWherein the acorn cradled. Follow.

FERDINAND

No;I will resist such entertainment tillMine enemy has more power.Draws, and is charmed from moving


MIRANDA

O dear father,Make not too rash a trial of him, forHe's gentle and not fearful.

PROSPERO

What? I say,My foot my tutor? Put thy sword up, traitor;Who makest a show but darest not strike, thy conscienceIs so possess'd with guilt: come from thy ward,For I can here disarm thee with this stickAnd make thy weapon drop.

MIRANDA

Beseech you, father.

PROSPERO

Hence! hang not on my garments.

MIRANDA

Sir, have pity;I'll be his surety.

PROSPERO

Silence! one word moreShall make me chide thee, if not hate thee. What!An advocate for an imposter! hush!Thou think'st there is no more such shapes as he,Having seen but him and Caliban: foolish wench!To the most of men this is a CalibanAnd they to him are angels.

MIRANDA

My affectionsAre then most humble; I have no ambitionTo see a goodlier man.

PROSPERO

Come on; obey:Thy nerves are in their infancy againAnd have no vigour in them.

FERDINAND

So they are;My spirits, as in a dream, are all bound up.My father's loss, the weakness which I feel,The wreck of all my friends, nor this man's threats,To whom I am subdued, are but light to me,Might I but through my prison once a dayBehold this maid: all corners else o' the earthLet liberty make use of; space enoughHave I in such a prison.

PROSPERO

[Aside]                It works.To FERDINAND
Come on.Thou hast done well, fine Ariel!To FERDINAND
Follow me.To ARIEL
Hark what thou else shalt do me.

MIRANDA

Be of comfort;My father's of a better nature, sir,Than he appears by speech: this is unwontedWhich now came from him.

PROSPERO

Thou shalt be freeAs mountain winds: but then exactly doAll points of my command.

ARIEL

To the syllable.

PROSPERO

Come, follow. Speak not for him.Exeunt

ACT II
SCENE I. Another part of the island.

Enter ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, GONZALO, ADRIAN, FRANCISCO, and others


GONZALO

Beseech you, sir, be merry; you have cause,So have we all, of joy; for our escapeIs much beyond our loss. Our hint of woeIs common; every day some sailor's wife,The masters of some merchant and the merchantHave just our theme of woe; but for the miracle,I mean our preservation, few in millionsCan speak like us: then wisely, good sir, weighOur sorrow with our comfort.

ALONSO

Prithee, peace.

SEBASTIAN

He receives comfort like cold porridge.

ANTONIO

The visitor will not give him o'er so.

SEBASTIAN

Look he's winding up the watch of his wit;by and by it will strike.

GONZALO

Sir,--

SEBASTIAN

One: tell.

GONZALO

When every grief is entertain'd that's offer'd,Comes to the entertainer--

SEBASTIAN

A dollar.

GONZALO

Dolour comes to him, indeed: youhave spoken truer than you purposed.

SEBASTIAN

You have taken it wiselier than I meant you should.

GONZALO

Therefore, my lord,--

ANTONIO

Fie, what a spendthrift is he of his tongue!

ALONSO

I prithee, spare.

GONZALO

Well, I have done: but yet,--

SEBASTIAN

He will be talking.

ANTONIO

Which, of he or Adrian, for a goodwager, first begins to crow?

SEBASTIAN

The old cock.

ANTONIO

The cockerel.

SEBASTIAN

Done. The wager?

ANTONIO

A laughter.

SEBASTIAN

A match!

ADRIAN

Though this island seem to be desert,--

SEBASTIAN

Ha, ha, ha! So, you're paid.

ADRIAN

Uninhabitable and almost inaccessible,--

SEBASTIAN

Yet,--

ADRIAN

Yet,--

ANTONIO

He could not miss't.

ADRIAN

It must needs be of subtle, tender and delicatetemperance.

ANTONIO

Temperance was a delicate wench.

SEBASTIAN

Ay, and a subtle; as he most learnedly delivered.

ADRIAN

The air breathes upon us here most sweetly.

SEBASTIAN

As if it had lungs and rotten ones.

ANTONIO

Or as 'twere perfumed by a fen.

GONZALO

Here is everything advantageous to life.

ANTONIO

True; save means to live.

SEBASTIAN

Of that there's none, or little.

GONZALO

How lush and lusty the grass looks! how green!

ANTONIO

The ground indeed is tawny.

SEBASTIAN

With an eye of green in't.

ANTONIO

He misses not much.

SEBASTIAN

No; he doth but mistake the truth totally.

GONZALO

But the rarity of it is,--which is indeed almostbeyond credit,--

SEBASTIAN

As many vouched rarities are.

GONZALO

That our garments, being, as they were, drenched inthe sea, hold notwithstanding their freshness andglosses, being rather new-dyed than stained withsalt water.

ANTONIO

If but one of his pockets could speak, would it notsay he lies?

SEBASTIAN

Ay, or very falsely pocket up his report

GONZALO

Methinks our garments are now as fresh as when weput them on first in Afric, at the marriage ofthe king's fair daughter Claribel to the King of Tunis.

SEBASTIAN

'Twas a sweet marriage, and we prosper well in our return.

ADRIAN

Tunis was never graced before with such a paragon totheir queen.

GONZALO

Not since widow Dido's time.

ANTONIO

Widow! a pox o' that! How came that widow in?widow Dido!

SEBASTIAN

What if he had said 'widower AEneas' too? Good Lord,how you take it!

ADRIAN

'Widow Dido' said you? you make me study of that:she was of Carthage, not of Tunis.

GONZALO

This Tunis, sir, was Carthage.

ADRIAN

Carthage?

GONZALO

I assure you, Carthage.

SEBASTIAN

His word is more than the miraculous harp; he hathraised the wall and houses too.

ANTONIO

What impossible matter will he make easy next?

SEBASTIAN

I think he will carry this island home in his pocketand give it his son for an apple.

ANTONIO

And, sowing the kernels of it in the sea, bringforth more islands.

GONZALO

Ay.

ANTONIO

Why, in good time.

GONZALO

Sir, we were talking that our garments seem nowas fresh as when we were at Tunis at the marriageof your daughter, who is now queen.

ANTONIO

And the rarest that e'er came there.

SEBASTIAN

Bate, I beseech you, widow Dido.

ANTONIO

O, widow Dido! ay, widow Dido.

GONZALO

Is not, sir, my doublet as fresh as the first day Iwore it? I mean, in a sort.

ANTONIO

That sort was well fished for.

GONZALO

When I wore it at your daughter's marriage?

ALONSO

You cram these words into mine ears againstThe stomach of my sense. Would I had neverMarried my daughter there! for, coming thence,My son is lost and, in my rate, she too,Who is so far from Italy removedI ne'er again shall see her. O thou mine heirOf Naples and of Milan, what strange fishHath made his meal on thee?

FRANCISCO

Sir, he may live:I saw him beat the surges under him,And ride upon their backs; he trod the water,Whose enmity he flung aside, and breastedThe surge most swoln that met him; his bold head'Bove the contentious waves he kept, and oar'dHimself with his good arms in lusty strokeTo the shore, that o'er his wave-worn basis bow'd,As stooping to relieve him: I not doubtHe came alive to land.

ALONSO

No, no, he's gone.

SEBASTIAN

Sir, you may thank yourself for this great loss,That would not bless our Europe with your daughter,But rather lose her to an African;Where she at least is banish'd from your eye,Who hath cause to wet the grief on't.

ALONSO

Prithee, peace.

SEBASTIAN

You were kneel'd to and importuned otherwiseBy all of us, and the fair soul herselfWeigh'd between loathness and obedience, atWhich end o' the beam should bow. We have lost yourson,I fear, for ever: Milan and Naples haveMore widows in them of this business' makingThan we bring men to comfort them:The fault's your own.

ALONSO

So is the dear'st o' the loss.

GONZALO

My lord Sebastian,The truth you speak doth lack some gentlenessAnd time to speak it in: you rub the sore,When you should bring the plaster.

SEBASTIAN

Very well.

ANTONIO

And most chirurgeonly.

GONZALO

It is foul weather in us all, good sir,When you are cloudy.

SEBASTIAN

Foul weather?

ANTONIO

Very foul.

GONZALO

Had I plantation of this isle, my lord,--

ANTONIO

He'ld sow't with nettle-seed.

SEBASTIAN

Or docks, or mallows.

GONZALO

And were the king on't, what would I do?

SEBASTIAN

'Scape being drunk for want of wine.

GONZALO

I' the commonwealth I would by contrariesExecute all things; for no kind of trafficWould I admit; no name of magistrate;Letters should not be known; riches, poverty,And use of service, none; contract, succession,Bourn, bound of land, tilth, vineyard, none;No use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil;No occupation; all men idle, all;And women too, but innocent and pure;No sovereignty;--

SEBASTIAN

                  Yet he would be king on't.

ANTONIO

The latter end of his commonwealth forgets thebeginning.

GONZALO

All things in common nature should produceWithout sweat or endeavour: treason, felony,Sword, pike, knife, gun, or need of any engine,Would I not have; but nature should bring forth,Of its own kind, all foison, all abundance,To feed my innocent people.

SEBASTIAN

No marrying 'mong his subjects?

ANTONIO

None, man; all idle: whores and knaves.

GONZALO

I would with such perfection govern, sir,To excel the golden age.

SEBASTIAN

God save his majesty!

ANTONIO

Long live Gonzalo!

GONZALO

                  And,--do you mark me, sir?

ALONSO

Prithee, no more: thou dost talk nothing to me.

GONZALO

I do well believe your highness; anddid it to minister occasion to these gentlemen,who are of such sensible and nimble lungs thatthey always use to laugh at nothing.

ANTONIO

'Twas you we laughed at.

GONZALO

Who in this kind of merry fooling am nothingto you: so you may continue and laugh atnothing still.

ANTONIO

What a blow was there given!

SEBASTIAN

An it had not fallen flat-long.

GONZALO

You are gentlemen of brave metal; you would liftthe moon out of her sphere, if she would continuein it five weeks without changing.Enter ARIEL, invisible, playing solemn music


SEBASTIAN

We would so, and then go a bat-fowling.

ANTONIO

Nay, good my lord, be not angry.

GONZALO

No, I warrant you; I will not adventuremy discretion so weakly. Will you laughme asleep, for I am very heavy?

ANTONIO

Go sleep, and hear us.All sleep except ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, and ANTONIO


ALONSO

What, all so soon asleep! I wish mine eyesWould, with themselves, shut up my thoughts: I findThey are inclined to do so.

SEBASTIAN

Please you, sir,Do not omit the heavy offer of it:It seldom visits sorrow; when it doth,It is a comforter.

ANTONIO

                  We two, my lord,Will guard your person while you take your rest,And watch your safety.

ALONSO

Thank you. Wondrous heavy.ALONSO sleeps. Exit ARIEL


SEBASTIAN

What a strange drowsiness possesses them!

ANTONIO

It is the quality o' the climate.

SEBASTIAN

WhyDoth it not then our eyelids sink? I find notMyself disposed to sleep.

ANTONIO

Nor I; my spirits are nimble.They fell together all, as by consent;They dropp'd, as by a thunder-stroke. What might,Worthy Sebastian? O, what might?--No more:--And yet me thinks I see it in thy face,What thou shouldst be: the occasion speaks thee, andMy strong imagination sees a crownDropping upon thy head.

SEBASTIAN

What, art thou waking?

ANTONIO

Do you not hear me speak?

SEBASTIAN

I do; and surelyIt is a sleepy language and thou speak'stOut of thy sleep. What is it thou didst say?This is a strange repose, to be asleepWith eyes wide open; standing, speaking, moving,And yet so fast asleep.

ANTONIO

Noble Sebastian,Thou let'st thy fortune sleep--die, rather; wink'stWhiles thou art waking.

SEBASTIAN

Thou dost snore distinctly;There's meaning in thy snores.

ANTONIO

I am more serious than my custom: youMust be so too, if heed me; which to doTrebles thee o'er.

SEBASTIAN

                  Well, I am standing water.

ANTONIO

I'll teach you how to flow.

SEBASTIAN

Do so: to ebbHereditary sloth instructs me.

ANTONIO

O,If you but knew how you the purpose cherishWhiles thus you mock it! how, in stripping it,You more invest it! Ebbing men, indeed,Most often do so near the bottom runBy their own fear or sloth.

SEBASTIAN

Prithee, say on:The setting of thine eye and cheek proclaimA matter from thee, and a birth indeedWhich throes thee much to yield.

ANTONIO

Thus, sir:Although this lord of weak remembrance, this,Who shall be of as little memoryWhen he is earth'd, hath here almost persuade,--For he's a spirit of persuasion, onlyProfesses to persuade,--the king his son's alive,'Tis as impossible that he's undrown'dAnd he that sleeps here swims.

SEBASTIAN

I have no hopeThat he's undrown'd.

ANTONIO

O, out of that 'no hope'What great hope have you! no hope that way isAnother way so high a hope that evenAmbition cannot pierce a wink beyond,But doubt discovery there. Will you grant with meThat Ferdinand is drown'd?

SEBASTIAN

He's gone.

ANTONIO

Then, tell me,Who's the next heir of Naples?

SEBASTIAN

Claribel.

ANTONIO

She that is queen of Tunis; she that dwellsTen leagues beyond man's life; she that from NaplesCan have no note, unless the sun were post--The man i' the moon's too slow--till new-born chinsBe rough and razorable; she that--from whom?We all were sea-swallow'd, though some cast again,And by that destiny to perform an actWhereof what's past is prologue, what to comeIn yours and my discharge.

SEBASTIAN

What stuff is this! how say you?'Tis true, my brother's daughter's queen of Tunis;So is she heir of Naples; 'twixt which regionsThere is some space.

ANTONIO

A space whose every cubitSeems to cry out, 'How shall that ClaribelMeasure us back to Naples? Keep in Tunis,And let Sebastian wake.' Say, this were deathThat now hath seized them; why, they were no worseThan now they are. There be that can rule NaplesAs well as he that sleeps; lords that can prateAs amply and unnecessarilyAs this Gonzalo; I myself could makeA chough of as deep chat. O, that you boreThe mind that I do! what a sleep were thisFor your advancement! Do you understand me?

SEBASTIAN

Methinks I do.

ANTONIO

                  And how does your contentTender your own good fortune?

SEBASTIAN

I rememberYou did supplant your brother Prospero.

ANTONIO

True:And look how well my garments sit upon me;Much feater than before: my brother's servantsWere then my fellows; now they are my men.

SEBASTIAN

But, for your conscience?

ANTONIO

Ay, sir; where lies that? if 'twere a kibe,'Twould put me to my slipper: but I feel notThis deity in my bosom: twenty consciences,That stand 'twixt me and Milan, candied be theyAnd melt ere they molest! Here lies your brother,No better than the earth he lies upon,If he were that which now he's like, that's dead;Whom I, with this obedient steel, three inches of it,Can lay to bed for ever; whiles you, doing thus,To the perpetual wink for aye might putThis ancient morsel, this Sir Prudence, whoShould not upbraid our course. For all the rest,They'll take suggestion as a cat laps milk;They'll tell the clock to any business thatWe say befits the hour.

SEBASTIAN

Thy case, dear friend,Shall be my precedent; as thou got'st Milan,I'll come by Naples. Draw thy sword: one strokeShall free thee from the tribute which thou payest;And I the king shall love thee.

ANTONIO

Draw together;And when I rear my hand, do you the like,To fall it on Gonzalo.

SEBASTIAN

O, but one word.They talk apart
Re-enter ARIEL, invisible


ARIEL

My master through his art foresees the dangerThat you, his friend, are in; and sends me forth--For else his project dies--to keep them living.Sings in GONZALO's ear
While you here do snoring lie,Open-eyed conspiracyHis time doth take.If of life you keep a care,Shake off slumber, and beware:Awake, awake!

ANTONIO

Then let us both be sudden.

GONZALO

Now, good angelsPreserve the king.They wake


ALONSO

Why, how now? ho, awake! Why are you drawn?Wherefore this ghastly looking?

GONZALO

What's the matter?

SEBASTIAN

Whiles we stood here securing your repose,Even now, we heard a hollow burst of bellowingLike bulls, or rather lions: did't not wake you?It struck mine ear most terribly.

ALONSO

I heard nothing.

ANTONIO

O, 'twas a din to fright a monster's ear,To make an earthquake! sure, it was the roarOf a whole herd of lions.

ALONSO

Heard you this, Gonzalo?

GONZALO

Upon mine honour, sir, I heard a humming,And that a strange one too, which did awake me:I shaked you, sir, and cried: as mine eyes open'd,I saw their weapons drawn: there was a noise,That's verily. 'Tis best we stand upon our guard,Or that we quit this place; let's draw our weapons.

ALONSO

Lead off this ground; and let's make further searchFor my poor son.

GONZALO

Heavens keep him from these beasts!For he is, sure, i' the island.

ALONSO

Lead away.

ARIEL

Prospero my lord shall know what I have done:So, king, go safely on to seek thy son.Exeunt

SCENE II. Another part of the island.

Enter CALIBAN with a burden of wood. A noise of thunder heard


CALIBAN

All the infections that the sun sucks upFrom bogs, fens, flats, on Prosper fall and make himBy inch-meal a disease! His spirits hear meAnd yet I needs must curse. But they'll nor pinch,Fright me with urchin--shows, pitch me i' the mire,Nor lead me, like a firebrand, in the darkOut of my way, unless he bid 'em; butFor every trifle are they set upon me;Sometime like apes that mow and chatter at meAnd after bite me, then like hedgehogs whichLie tumbling in my barefoot way and mountTheir pricks at my footfall; sometime am IAll wound with adders who with cloven tonguesDo hiss me into madness.Enter TRINCULO
Lo, now, lo!Here comes a spirit of his, and to torment meFor bringing wood in slowly. I'll fall flat;Perchance he will not mind me.

TRINCULO

Here's neither bush nor shrub, to bear offany weather at all, and another storm brewing;I hear it sing i' the wind: yond same blackcloud, yond huge one, looks like a foulbombard that would shed his liquor. If itshould thunder as it did before, I know notwhere to hide my head: yond same cloud cannotchoose but fall by pailfuls. What have wehere? a man or a fish? dead or alive? A fish:he smells like a fish; a very ancient and fish-like smell; a kind of not of the newest Poor-John. A strange fish! Were I in England now,as once I was, and had but this fish painted,not a holiday fool there but would give a pieceof silver: there would this monster make aman; any strange beast there makes a man:when they will not give a doit to relieve a lamebeggar, they will lazy out ten to see a deadIndian. Legged like a man and his fins likearms! Warm o' my troth! I do now let loosemy opinion; hold it no longer: this is no fish,but an islander, that hath lately suffered by athunderbolt.Thunder
Alas, the storm is come again! my best way is tocreep under his gaberdine; there is no othershelter hereabouts: misery acquaints a man withstrange bed-fellows. I will here shroud till thedregs of the storm be past.Enter STEPHANO, singing: a bottle in his hand


STEPHANO

   I shall no more to sea, to sea,Here shall I die ashore--This is a very scurvy tune to sing at a man'sfuneral: well, here's my comfort.Drinks
Sings
The master, the swabber, the boatswain and I,The gunner and his mateLoved Mall, Meg and Marian and Margery,But none of us cared for Kate;For she had a tongue with a tang,Would cry to a sailor, Go hang!She loved not the savour of tar nor of pitch,Yet a tailor might scratch her where'er she did itch:Then to sea, boys, and let her go hang!This is a scurvy tune too: but here's my comfort.Drinks


CALIBAN

Do not torment me: Oh!

STEPHANO

What's the matter? Have we devils here? Do you puttricks upon's with savages and men of Ind, ha? Ihave not scaped drowning to be afeard now of yourfour legs; for it hath been said, As proper a man asever went on four legs cannot make him give ground;and it shall be said so again while Stephanobreathes at's nostrils.

CALIBAN

The spirit torments me; Oh!

STEPHANO

This is some monster of the isle with four legs, whohath got, as I take it, an ague. Where the devilshould he learn our language? I will give him somerelief, if it be but for that. if I can recover himand keep him tame and get to Naples with him, he's apresent for any emperor that ever trod on neat's leather.

CALIBAN

Do not torment me, prithee; I'll bring my wood home faster.

STEPHANO

He's in his fit now and does not talk after thewisest. He shall taste of my bottle: if he havenever drunk wine afore will go near to remove hisfit. If I can recover him and keep him tame, I willnot take too much for him; he shall pay for him thathath him, and that soundly.

CALIBAN

Thou dost me yet but little hurt; thou wilt anon, Iknow it by thy trembling: now Prosper works upon thee.

STEPHANO

Come on your ways; open your mouth; here is thatwhich will give language to you, cat: open yourmouth; this will shake your shaking, I can tell you,and that soundly: you cannot tell who's your friend:open your chaps again.

TRINCULO

I should know that voice: it should be--but he isdrowned; and these are devils: O defend me!

STEPHANO

Four legs and two voices: a most delicate monster!His forward voice now is to speak well of hisfriend; his backward voice is to utter foul speechesand to detract. If all the wine in my bottle willrecover him, I will help his ague. Come. Amen! Iwill pour some in thy other mouth.

TRINCULO

Stephano!

STEPHANO

Doth thy other mouth call me? Mercy, mercy! This isa devil, and no monster: I will leave him; I have nolong spoon.

TRINCULO

Stephano! If thou beest Stephano, touch me andspeak to me: for I am Trinculo--be not afeard--thygood friend Trinculo.

STEPHANO

If thou beest Trinculo, come forth: I'll pull theeby the lesser legs: if any be Trinculo's legs,these are they. Thou art very Trinculo indeed! Howcamest thou to be the siege of this moon-calf? canhe vent Trinculos?

TRINCULO

I took him to be killed with a thunder-stroke. Butart thou not drowned, Stephano? I hope now thou artnot drowned. Is the storm overblown? I hid meunder the dead moon-calf's gaberdine for fear ofthe storm. And art thou living, Stephano? OStephano, two Neapolitans 'scaped!

STEPHANO

Prithee, do not turn me about; my stomach is not constant.

CALIBAN

[Aside]  These be fine things, an if they benot sprites.That's a brave god and bears celestial liquor.I will kneel to him.

STEPHANO

How didst thou 'scape? How camest thou hither?swear by this bottle how thou camest hither. Iescaped upon a butt of sack which the sailorsheaved o'erboard, by this bottle; which I made ofthe bark of a tree with mine own hands since I wascast ashore.

CALIBAN

I'll swear upon that bottle to be thy true subject;for the liquor is not earthly.

STEPHANO

Here; swear then how thou escapedst.

TRINCULO

Swum ashore. man, like a duck: I can swim like aduck, I'll be sworn.

STEPHANO

Here, kiss the book. Though thou canst swim like aduck, thou art made like a goose.

TRINCULO

O Stephano. hast any more of this?

STEPHANO

The whole butt, man: my cellar is in a rock by thesea-side where my wine is hid. How now, moon-calf!how does thine ague?

CALIBAN

Hast thou not dropp'd from heaven?

STEPHANO

Out o' the moon, I do assure thee: I was the man i'the moon when time was.

CALIBAN

I have seen thee in her and I do adore thee:My mistress show'd me thee and thy dog and thy bush.

STEPHANO

Come, swear to that; kiss the book: I will furnishit anon with new contents swear.

TRINCULO

By this good light, this is a very shallow monster!I afeard of him! A very weak monster! The man i'the moon! A most poor credulous monster! Welldrawn, monster, in good sooth!

CALIBAN

I'll show thee every fertile inch o' th' island;And I will kiss thy foot: I prithee, be my god.

TRINCULO

By this light, a most perfidious and drunkenmonster! when 's god's asleep, he'll rob his bottle.

CALIBAN

I'll kiss thy foot; I'll swear myself thy subject.

STEPHANO

Come on then; down, and swear.

TRINCULO

I shall laugh myself to death at this puppy-headedmonster. A most scurvy monster! I could find in myheart to beat him,--

STEPHANO

Come, kiss.

TRINCULO

But that the poor monster's in drink: an abominable monster!

CALIBAN

I'll show thee the best springs; I'll pluck thee berries;I'll fish for thee and get thee wood enough.A plague upon the tyrant that I serve!I'll bear him no more sticks, but follow thee,Thou wondrous man.

TRINCULO

A most ridiculous monster, to make a wonder of aPoor drunkard!

CALIBAN

I prithee, let me bring thee where crabs grow;And I with my long nails will dig thee pignuts;Show thee a jay's nest and instruct thee howTo snare the nimble marmoset; I'll bring theeTo clustering filberts and sometimes I'll get theeYoung scamels from the rock. Wilt thou go with me?

STEPHANO

I prithee now, lead the way without any moretalking. Trinculo, the king and all our companyelse being drowned, we will inherit here: here;bear my bottle: fellow Trinculo, we'll fill him byand by again.

CALIBAN

[Sings drunkenly]Farewell master; farewell, farewell!

TRINCULO

A howling monster: a drunken monster!

CALIBAN

   No more dams I'll make for fishNor fetch in firingAt requiring;Nor scrape trencher, nor wash dish'Ban, 'Ban, CacalibanHas a new master: get a new man.Freedom, hey-day! hey-day, freedom! freedom,hey-day, freedom!

STEPHANO

O brave monster! Lead the way.Exeunt

ACT III
SCENE I. Before PROSPERO'S Cell.

Enter FERDINAND, bearing a log


FERDINAND

There be some sports are painful, and their labourDelight in them sets off: some kinds of basenessAre nobly undergone and most poor mattersPoint to rich ends. This my mean taskWould be as heavy to me as odious, butThe mistress which I serve quickens what's deadAnd makes my labours pleasures: O, she isTen times more gentle than her father's crabbed,And he's composed of harshness. I must removeSome thousands of these logs and pile them up,Upon a sore injunction: my sweet mistressWeeps when she sees me work, and says, such basenessHad never like executor. I forget:But these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labours,Most busy lest, when I do it.Enter MIRANDA; and PROSPERO at a distance, unseen


MIRANDA

Alas, now, pray you,Work not so hard: I would the lightning hadBurnt up those logs that you are enjoin'd to pile!Pray, set it down and rest you: when this burns,'Twill weep for having wearied you. My fatherIs hard at study; pray now, rest yourself;He's safe for these three hours.

FERDINAND

O most dear mistress,The sun will set before I shall dischargeWhat I must strive to do.

MIRANDA

If you'll sit down,I'll bear your logs the while: pray, give me that;I'll carry it to the pile.

FERDINAND

No, precious creature;I had rather crack my sinews, break my back,Than you should such dishonour undergo,While I sit lazy by.

MIRANDA

It would become meAs well as it does you: and I should do itWith much more ease; for my good will is to it,And yours it is against.

PROSPERO

Poor worm, thou art infected!This visitation shows it.

MIRANDA

You look wearily.

FERDINAND

No, noble mistress;'tis fresh morning with meWhen you are by at night. I do beseech you--Chiefly that I might set it in my prayers--What is your name?

MIRANDA

                  Miranda.--O my father,I have broke your hest to say so!

FERDINAND

Admired Miranda!Indeed the top of admiration! worthWhat's dearest to the world! Full many a ladyI have eyed with best regard and many a timeThe harmony of their tongues hath into bondageBrought my too diligent ear: for several virtuesHave I liked several women; never anyWith so fun soul, but some defect in herDid quarrel with the noblest grace she owedAnd put it to the foil: but you, O you,So perfect and so peerless, are createdOf every creature's best!

MIRANDA

I do not knowOne of my sex; no woman's face remember,Save, from my glass, mine own; nor have I seenMore that I may call men than you, good friend,And my dear father: how features are abroad,I am skilless of; but, by my modesty,The jewel in my dower, I would not wishAny companion in the world but you,Nor can imagination form a shape,Besides yourself, to like of. But I prattleSomething too wildly and my father's preceptsI therein do forget.

FERDINAND

I am in my conditionA prince, Miranda; I do think, a king;I would, not so!--and would no more endureThis wooden slavery than to sufferThe flesh-fly blow my mouth. Hear my soul speak:The very instant that I saw you, didMy heart fly to your service; there resides,To make me slave to it; and for your sakeAm I this patient log--man.

MIRANDA

Do you love me?

FERDINAND

O heaven, O earth, bear witness to this soundAnd crown what I profess with kind eventIf I speak true! if hollowly, invertWhat best is boded me to mischief! IBeyond all limit of what else i' the worldDo love, prize, honour you.

MIRANDA

I am a foolTo weep at what I am glad of.

PROSPERO

Fair encounterOf two most rare affections! Heavens rain graceOn that which breeds between 'em!

FERDINAND

Wherefore weep you?

MIRANDA

At mine unworthiness that dare not offerWhat I desire to give, and much less takeWhat I shall die to want. But this is trifling;And all the more it seeks to hide itself,The bigger bulk it shows. Hence, bashful cunning!And prompt me, plain and holy innocence!I am your wife, if you will marry me;If not, I'll die your maid: to be your fellowYou may deny me; but I'll be your servant,Whether you will or no.

FERDINAND

My mistress, dearest;And I thus humble ever.

MIRANDA

My husband, then?

FERDINAND

Ay, with a heart as willingAs bondage e'er of freedom: here's my hand.

MIRANDA

And mine, with my heart in't; and now farewellTill half an hour hence.

FERDINAND

A thousand thousand!Exeunt FERDINAND and MIRANDA severally


PROSPERO

So glad of this as they I cannot be,Who are surprised withal; but my rejoicingAt nothing can be more. I'll to my book,For yet ere supper-time must I performMuch business appertaining.Exit

SCENE II. Another part of the island.

Enter CALIBAN, STEPHANO, and TRINCULO


STEPHANO

Tell not me; when the butt is out, we will drinkwater; not a drop before: therefore bear up, andboard 'em. Servant-monster, drink to me.

TRINCULO

Servant-monster! the folly of this island! Theysay there's but five upon this isle: we are threeof them; if th' other two be brained like us, thestate totters.

STEPHANO

Drink, servant-monster, when I bid thee: thy eyesare almost set in thy head.

TRINCULO

Where should they be set else? he were a bravemonster indeed, if they were set in his tail.

STEPHANO

My man-monster hath drown'd his tongue in sack:for my part, the sea cannot drown me; I swam, ere Icould recover the shore, five and thirty leagues offand on. By this light, thou shalt be my lieutenant,monster, or my standard.

TRINCULO

Your lieutenant, if you list; he's no standard.

STEPHANO

We'll not run, Monsieur Monster.

TRINCULO

Nor go neither; but you'll lie like dogs and yet saynothing neither.

STEPHANO

Moon-calf, speak once in thy life, if thou beest agood moon-calf.

CALIBAN

How does thy honour? Let me lick thy shoe.I'll not serve him; he's not valiant.

TRINCULO

Thou liest, most ignorant monster: I am in case tojustle a constable. Why, thou deboshed fish thou,was there ever man a coward that hath drunk so muchsack as I to-day? Wilt thou tell a monstrous lie,being but half a fish and half a monster?

CALIBAN

Lo, how he mocks me! wilt thou let him, my lord?

TRINCULO

'Lord' quoth he! That a monster should be such a natural!

CALIBAN

Lo, lo, again! bite him to death, I prithee.

STEPHANO

Trinculo, keep a good tongue in your head: if youprove a mutineer,--the next tree! The poor monster'smy subject and he shall not suffer indignity.

CALIBAN

I thank my noble lord. Wilt thou be pleased tohearken once again to the suit I made to thee?

STEPHANO

Marry, will I	kneel and repeat it; I will stand,and so shall Trinculo.Enter ARIEL, invisible


CALIBAN

As I told thee before, I am subject to a tyrant, asorcerer, that by his cunning hath cheated me of the island.

ARIEL

Thou liest.

CALIBAN

Thou liest, thou jesting monkey, thou: I would myvaliant master would destroy thee! I do not lie.

STEPHANO

Trinculo, if you trouble him any more in's tale, bythis hand, I will supplant some of your teeth.

TRINCULO

Why, I said nothing.

STEPHANO

Mum, then, and no more. Proceed.

CALIBAN

I say, by sorcery he got this isle;From me he got it. if thy greatness willRevenge it on him,--for I know thou darest,But this thing dare not,--

STEPHANO

That's most certain.

CALIBAN

Thou shalt be lord of it and I'll serve thee.

STEPHANO

How now shall this be compassed?Canst thou bring me to the party?

CALIBAN

Yea, yea, my lord: I'll yield him thee asleep,Where thou mayst knock a nail into his bead.

ARIEL

Thou liest; thou canst not.

CALIBAN

What a pied ninny's this! Thou scurvy patch!I do beseech thy greatness, give him blowsAnd take his bottle from him: when that's goneHe shall drink nought but brine; for I'll not show himWhere the quick freshes are.

STEPHANO

Trinculo, run into no further danger:interrupt the monster one word further, and,by this hand, I'll turn my mercy out o' doorsand make a stock-fish of thee.

TRINCULO

Why, what did I? I did nothing. I'll go fartheroff.

STEPHANO

Didst thou not say he lied?

ARIEL

Thou liest.

STEPHANO

Do I so? take thou that.Beats TRINCULO
As you like this, give me the lie another time.

TRINCULO

I did not give the lie. Out o' yourwits and bearing too? A pox o' your bottle!this can sack and drinking do. A murrain onyour monster, and the devil take your fingers!

CALIBAN

Ha, ha, ha!

STEPHANO

Now, forward with your tale. Prithee, stand fartheroff.

CALIBAN

Beat him enough: after a little timeI'll beat him too.

STEPHANO

                  Stand farther. Come, proceed.

CALIBAN

Why, as I told thee, 'tis a custom with him,I' th' afternoon to sleep: there thou mayst brain him,Having first seized his books, or with a logBatter his skull, or paunch him with a stake,Or cut his wezand with thy knife. RememberFirst to possess his books; for without themHe's but a sot, as I am, nor hath notOne spirit to command: they all do hate himAs rootedly as I. Burn but his books.He has brave utensils,--for so he calls them--Which when he has a house, he'll deck withalAnd that most deeply to consider isThe beauty of his daughter; he himselfCalls her a nonpareil: I never saw a woman,But only Sycorax my dam and she;But she as far surpasseth SycoraxAs great'st does least.

STEPHANO

Is it so brave a lass?

CALIBAN

Ay, lord; she will become thy bed, I warrant.And bring thee forth brave brood.

STEPHANO

Monster, I will kill this man: his daughter and Iwill be king and queen--save our graces!--andTrinculo and thyself shall be viceroys. Dost thoulike the plot, Trinculo?

TRINCULO

Excellent.

STEPHANO

Give me thy hand: I am sorry I beat thee; but,while thou livest, keep a good tongue in thy head.

CALIBAN

Within this half hour will he be asleep:Wilt thou destroy him then?

STEPHANO

Ay, on mine honour.

ARIEL

This will I tell my master.

CALIBAN

Thou makest me merry; I am full of pleasure:Let us be jocund: will you troll the catchYou taught me but while-ere?

STEPHANO

At thy request, monster, I will do reason, anyreason. Come on, Trinculo, let us sing.Sings
Flout 'em and scout 'emAnd scout 'em and flout 'emThought is free.

CALIBAN

That's not the tune.Ariel plays the tune on a tabour and pipe


STEPHANO

What is this same?

TRINCULO

This is the tune of our catch, played by the pictureof Nobody.

STEPHANO

If thou beest a man, show thyself in thy likeness:if thou beest a devil, take't as thou list.

TRINCULO

O, forgive me my sins!

STEPHANO

He that dies pays all debts: I defy thee. Mercy upon us!

CALIBAN

Art thou afeard?

STEPHANO

No, monster, not I.

CALIBAN

Be not afeard; the isle is full of noises,Sounds and sweet airs, that give delight and hurt not.Sometimes a thousand twangling instrumentsWill hum about mine ears, and sometime voicesThat, if I then had waked after long sleep,Will make me sleep again: and then, in dreaming,The clouds methought would open and show richesReady to drop upon me that, when I waked,I cried to dream again.

STEPHANO

This will prove a brave kingdom to me, where I shallhave my music for nothing.

CALIBAN

When Prospero is destroyed.

STEPHANO

That shall be by and by: I remember the story.

TRINCULO

The sound is going away; let's follow it, andafter do our work.

STEPHANO

Lead, monster; we'll follow. I would I could seethis tabourer; he lays it on.

TRINCULO

Wilt come? I'll follow, Stephano.Exeunt

SCENE III. Another part of the island.

Enter ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, GONZALO, ADRIAN, FRANCISCO, and others


GONZALO

By'r lakin, I can go no further, sir;My old bones ache: here's a maze trod indeedThrough forth-rights and meanders! By your patience,I needs must rest me.

ALONSO

Old lord, I cannot blame thee,Who am myself attach'd with weariness,To the dulling of my spirits: sit down, and rest.Even here I will put off my hope and keep itNo longer for my flatterer: he is drown'dWhom thus we stray to find, and the sea mocksOur frustrate search on land. Well, let him go.

ANTONIO

[Aside to SEBASTIAN]  I am right glad that he's soout of hope.Do not, for one repulse, forego the purposeThat you resolved to effect.

SEBASTIAN

[Aside to ANTONIO]  The next advantageWill we take throughly.

ANTONIO

[Aside to SEBASTIAN]  Let it be to-night;For, now they are oppress'd with travel, theyWill not, nor cannot, use such vigilanceAs when they are fresh.

SEBASTIAN

[Aside to ANTONIO]  I say, to-night: no more.Solemn and strange music


ALONSO

What harmony is this? My good friends, hark!

GONZALO

Marvellous sweet music!Enter PROSPERO above, invisible. Enter several  strange Shapes, bringing in a banquet;  they dance about it with gentle actions of  salutation; and, inviting the King,  & c. to eat, they depart


ALONSO

Give us kind keepers, heavens! What were these?

SEBASTIAN

A living drollery. Now I will believeThat there are unicorns, that in ArabiaThere is one tree, the phoenix' throne, one phoenixAt this hour reigning there.

ANTONIO

I'll believe both;And what does else want credit, come to me,And I'll be sworn 'tis true: travellers ne'er didlie,Though fools at home condemn 'em.

GONZALO

If in NaplesI should report this now, would they believe me?If I should say, I saw such islanders--For, certes, these are people of the island--Who, though they are of monstrous shape, yet, note,Their manners are more gentle-kind than ofOur human generation you shall findMany, nay, almost any.

PROSPERO

[Aside]              Honest lord,Thou hast said well; for some of you there presentAre worse than devils.

ALONSO

I cannot too much museSuch shapes, such gesture and such sound, expressing,Although they want the use of tongue, a kindOf excellent dumb discourse.

PROSPERO

[Aside]	Praise in departing.

FRANCISCO

They vanish'd strangely.

SEBASTIAN

No matter, sinceThey have left their viands behind; for we have stomachs.Will't please you taste of what is here?

ALONSO

Not I.

GONZALO

Faith, sir, you need not fear. When we were boys,Who would believe that there were mountaineersDew-lapp'd like bulls, whose throats had hanging at 'emWallets of flesh? or that there were such menWhose heads stood in their breasts? which now we findEach putter-out of five for one will bring usGood warrant of.

ALONSO

                  I will stand to and feed,Although my last: no matter, since I feelThe best is past. Brother, my lord the duke,Stand to and do as we.Thunder and lightning. Enter ARIEL, like a  harpy; claps his wings upon the table; and, with a quaint device, the banquet vanishes


ARIEL

You are three men of sin, whom Destiny,That hath to instrument this lower worldAnd what is in't, the never-surfeited seaHath caused to belch up you; and on this islandWhere man doth not inhabit; you 'mongst menBeing most unfit to live. I have made you mad;And even with such-like valour men hang and drownTheir proper selves.ALONSO, SEBASTIAN  & c. draw their swords
You fools! I and my fellowsAre ministers of Fate: the elements,Of whom your swords are temper'd, may as wellWound the loud winds, or with bemock'd-at stabsKill the still-closing waters, as diminishOne dowle that's in my plume: my fellow-ministersAre like invulnerable. If you could hurt,Your swords are now too massy for your strengthsAnd will not be uplifted. But remember--For that's my business to you--that you threeFrom Milan did supplant good Prospero;Exposed unto the sea, which hath requit it,Him and his innocent child: for which foul deedThe powers, delaying, not forgetting, haveIncensed the seas and shores, yea, all the creatures,Against your peace. Thee of thy son, Alonso,They have bereft; and do pronounce by me:Lingering perdition, worse than any deathCan be at once, shall step by step attendYou and your ways; whose wraths to guard you from--Which here, in this most desolate isle, else fallsUpon your heads--is nothing but heart-sorrowAnd a clear life ensuing.He vanishes in thunder; then, to soft music  enter the Shapes again, and dance, with mocks and mows, and carrying out the table


PROSPERO

Bravely the figure of this harpy hast thouPerform'd, my Ariel; a grace it had, devouring:Of my instruction hast thou nothing batedIn what thou hadst to say: so, with good lifeAnd observation strange, my meaner ministersTheir several kinds have done. My high charms workAnd these mine enemies are all knit upIn their distractions; they now are in my power;And in these fits I leave them, while I visitYoung Ferdinand, whom they suppose is drown'd,And his and mine loved darling.Exit above


GONZALO

I' the name of something holy, sir, why stand youIn this strange stare?

ALONSO

O, it is monstrous, monstrous:Methought the billows spoke and told me of it;The winds did sing it to me, and the thunder,That deep and dreadful organ-pipe, pronouncedThe name of Prosper: it did bass my trespass.Therefore my son i' the ooze is bedded, andI'll seek him deeper than e'er plummet soundedAnd with him there lie mudded.Exit


SEBASTIAN

But one fiend at a time,I'll fight their legions o'er.

ANTONIO

I'll be thy second.Exeunt SEBASTIAN, and ANTONIO


GONZALO

All three of them are desperate: their great guilt,Like poison given to work a great time after,Now 'gins to bite the spirits. I do beseech youThat are of suppler joints, follow them swiftlyAnd hinder them from what this ecstasyMay now provoke them to.

ADRIAN

Follow, I pray you.Exeunt

ACT IV
SCENE I. Before PROSPERO'S cell.

Enter PROSPERO, FERDINAND, and MIRANDA


PROSPERO

If I have too austerely punish'd you,Your compensation makes amends, for IHave given you here a third of mine own life,Or that for which I live; who once againI tender to thy hand: all thy vexationsWere but my trials of thy love and thouHast strangely stood the test here, afore Heaven,I ratify this my rich gift. O Ferdinand,Do not smile at me that I boast her off,For thou shalt find she will outstrip all praiseAnd make it halt behind her.

FERDINAND

I do believe itAgainst an oracle.

PROSPERO

Then, as my gift and thine own acquisitionWorthily purchased take my daughter: butIf thou dost break her virgin-knot beforeAll sanctimonious ceremonies mayWith full and holy rite be minister'd,No sweet aspersion shall the heavens let fallTo make this contract grow: but barren hate,Sour-eyed disdain and discord shall bestrewThe union of your bed with weeds so loathlyThat you shall hate it both: therefore take heed,As Hymen's lamps shall light you.

FERDINAND

As I hopeFor quiet days, fair issue and long life,With such love as 'tis now, the murkiest den,The most opportune place, the strong'st suggestion.Our worser genius can, shall never meltMine honour into lust, to take awayThe edge of that day's celebrationWhen I shall think: or Phoebus' steeds are founder'd,Or Night kept chain'd below.

PROSPERO

Fairly spoke.Sit then and talk with her; she is thine own.What, Ariel! my industrious servant, Ariel!Enter ARIEL


ARIEL

What would my potent master? here I am.

PROSPERO

Thou and thy meaner fellows your last serviceDid worthily perform; and I must use youIn such another trick. Go bring the rabble,O'er whom I give thee power, here to this place:Incite them to quick motion; for I mustBestow upon the eyes of this young coupleSome vanity of mine art: it is my promise,And they expect it from me.

ARIEL

Presently?

PROSPERO

Ay, with a twink.

ARIEL

   Before you can say 'come' and 'go,'And breathe twice and cry 'so, so,'Each one, tripping on his toe,Will be here with mop and mow.Do you love me, master? no?

PROSPERO

Dearly my delicate Ariel. Do not approachTill thou dost hear me call.

ARIEL

Well, I conceive.Exit


PROSPERO

Look thou be true; do not give dallianceToo much the rein: the strongest oaths are strawTo the fire i' the blood: be more abstemious,Or else, good night your vow!

FERDINAND

I warrant you sir;The white cold virgin snow upon my heartAbates the ardour of my liver.

PROSPERO

Well.Now come, my Ariel! bring a corollary,Rather than want a spirit: appear and pertly!No tongue! all eyes! be silent.Soft music
Enter IRIS


IRIS

Ceres, most bounteous lady, thy rich leasOf wheat, rye, barley, vetches, oats and pease;Thy turfy mountains, where live nibbling sheep,And flat meads thatch'd with stover, them to keep;Thy banks with pioned and twilled brims,Which spongy April at thy hest betrims,To make cold nymphs chaste crowns; and thy broom -groves,Whose shadow the dismissed bachelor loves,Being lass-lorn: thy pole-clipt vineyard;And thy sea-marge, sterile and rocky-hard,Where thou thyself dost air;--the queen o' the sky,Whose watery arch and messenger am I,Bids thee leave these, and with her sovereign grace,Here on this grass-plot, in this very place,To come and sport: her peacocks fly amain:Approach, rich Ceres, her to entertain.Enter CERES


CERES

Hail, many-colour'd messenger, that ne'erDost disobey the wife of Jupiter;Who with thy saffron wings upon my flowersDiffusest honey-drops, refreshing showers,And with each end of thy blue bow dost crownMy bosky acres and my unshrubb'd down,Rich scarf to my proud earth; why hath thy queenSummon'd me hither, to this short-grass'd green?

IRIS

A contract of true love to celebrate;And some donation freely to estateOn the blest lovers.

CERES

Tell me, heavenly bow,If Venus or her son, as thou dost know,Do now attend the queen? Since they did plotThe means that dusky Dis my daughter got,Her and her blind boy's scandal'd companyI have forsworn.

IRIS

                  Of her societyBe not afraid: I met her deityCutting the clouds towards Paphos and her sonDove-drawn with her. Here thought they to have doneSome wanton charm upon this man and maid,Whose vows are, that no bed-right shall be paidTill Hymen's torch be lighted: but vain;Mars's hot minion is returned again;Her waspish-headed son has broke his arrows,Swears he will shoot no more but play with sparrowsAnd be a boy right out.

CERES

High'st queen of state,Great Juno, comes; I know her by her gait.Enter JUNO


JUNO

How does my bounteous sister? Go with meTo bless this twain, that they may prosperous beAnd honour'd in their issue.They sing:


JUNO

   Honour, riches, marriage-blessing,Long continuance, and increasing,Hourly joys be still upon you!Juno sings her blessings upon you.

CERES

   Earth's increase, foison plenty,Barns and garners never empty,Vines and clustering bunches growing,Plants with goodly burthen bowing;Spring come to you at the farthestIn the very end of harvest!Scarcity and want shall shun you;Ceres' blessing so is on you.

FERDINAND

This is a most majestic vision, andHarmoniously charmingly. May I be boldTo think these spirits?

PROSPERO

Spirits, which by mine artI have from their confines call'd to enactMy present fancies.

FERDINAND

Let me live here ever;So rare a wonder'd father and a wifeMakes this place Paradise.Juno and Ceres whisper, and send Iris on employment


PROSPERO

Sweet, now, silence!Juno and Ceres whisper seriously;There's something else to do: hush, and be mute,Or else our spell is marr'd.

IRIS

You nymphs, call'd Naiads, of the windring brooks,With your sedged crowns and ever-harmless looks,Leave your crisp channels and on this green landAnswer your summons; Juno does command:Come, temperate nymphs, and help to celebrateA contract of true love; be not too late.Enter certain Nymphs
You sunburnt sicklemen, of August weary,Come hither from the furrow and be merry:Make holiday; your rye-straw hats put onAnd these fresh nymphs encounter every oneIn country footing.Enter certain Reapers, properly habited: they  join with the Nymphs in a graceful dance;  towards the end whereof PROSPERO starts  suddenly, and speaks; after which, to a  strange, hollow, and confused noise, they heavily vanish


PROSPERO

[Aside]  I had forgot that foul conspiracyOf the beast Caliban and his confederatesAgainst my life: the minute of their plotIs almost come.To the Spirits
Well done! avoid; no more!

FERDINAND

This is strange: your father's in some passionThat works him strongly.

MIRANDA

Never till this daySaw I him touch'd with anger so distemper'd.

PROSPERO

You do look, my son, in a moved sort,As if you were dismay'd: be cheerful, sir.Our revels now are ended. These our actors,As I foretold you, were all spirits andAre melted into air, into thin air:And, like the baseless fabric of this vision,The cloud-capp'd towers, the gorgeous palaces,The solemn temples, the great globe itself,Ye all which it inherit, shall dissolveAnd, like this insubstantial pageant faded,Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuffAs dreams are made on, and our little lifeIs rounded with a sleep. Sir, I am vex'd;Bear with my weakness; my, brain is troubled:Be not disturb'd with my infirmity:If you be pleased, retire into my cellAnd there repose: a turn or two I'll walk,To still my beating mind.

FERDINAND

MIRANDA

We wish your peace.Exeunt


PROSPERO

Come with a thought I thank thee, Ariel: come.Enter ARIEL


ARIEL

Thy thoughts I cleave to. What's thy pleasure?

PROSPERO

Spirit,We must prepare to meet with Caliban.

ARIEL

Ay, my commander: when I presented Ceres,I thought to have told thee of it, but I fear'dLest I might anger thee.

PROSPERO

Say again, where didst thou leave these varlets?

ARIEL

I told you, sir, they were red-hot with drinking;So fun of valour that they smote the airFor breathing in their faces; beat the groundFor kissing of their feet; yet always bendingTowards their project. Then I beat my tabour;At which, like unback'd colts, they prick'dtheir ears,Advanced their eyelids, lifted up their nosesAs they smelt music: so I charm'd their earsThat calf-like they my lowing follow'd throughTooth'd briers, sharp furzes, pricking goss and thorns,Which entered their frail shins: at last I left themI' the filthy-mantled pool beyond your cell,There dancing up to the chins, that the foul lakeO'erstunk their feet.

PROSPERO

This was well done, my bird.Thy shape invisible retain thou still:The trumpery in my house, go bring it hither,For stale to catch these thieves.

ARIEL

I go, I go.Exit


PROSPERO

A devil, a born devil, on whose natureNurture can never stick; on whom my pains,Humanely taken, all, all lost, quite lost;And as with age his body uglier grows,So his mind cankers. I will plague them all,Even to roaring.Re-enter ARIEL, loaden with glistering apparel,  & c
Come, hang them on this line.PROSPERO and ARIEL remain invisible. Enter CALIBAN, STEPHANO, and TRINCULO, all wet


CALIBAN

Pray you, tread softly, that the blind mole may notHear a foot fall: we now are near his cell.

STEPHANO

Monster, your fairy, which you say isa harmless fairy, has done little better thanplayed the Jack with us.

TRINCULO

Monster, I do smell all horse-piss; atwhich my nose is in great indignation.

STEPHANO

So is mine. Do you hear, monster? If I should takea displeasure against you, look you,--

TRINCULO

Thou wert but a lost monster.

CALIBAN

Good my lord, give me thy favour still.Be patient, for the prize I'll bring thee toShall hoodwink this mischance: therefore speak softly.All's hush'd as midnight yet.

TRINCULO

Ay, but to lose our bottles in the pool,--

STEPHANO

There is not only disgrace and dishonour in that,monster, but an infinite loss.

TRINCULO

That's more to me than my wetting: yet this is yourharmless fairy, monster.

STEPHANO

I will fetch off my bottle, though I be o'er earsfor my labour.

CALIBAN

Prithee, my king, be quiet. Seest thou here,This is the mouth o' the cell: no noise, and enter.Do that good mischief which may make this islandThine own for ever, and I, thy Caliban,For aye thy foot-licker.

STEPHANO

Give me thy hand. I do begin to have bloody thoughts.

TRINCULO

O king Stephano! O peer! O worthy Stephano! lookwhat a wardrobe here is for thee!

CALIBAN

Let it alone, thou fool; it is but trash.

TRINCULO

O, ho, monster! we know what belongs to a frippery.O king Stephano!

STEPHANO

Put off that gown, Trinculo; by this hand, I'll havethat gown.

TRINCULO

Thy grace shall have it.

CALIBAN

The dropsy drown this fool I what do you meanTo dote thus on such luggage? Let's aloneAnd do the murder first: if he awake,From toe to crown he'll fill our skins with pinches,Make us strange stuff.

STEPHANO

Be you quiet, monster. Mistress line,is not this my jerkin? Now is the jerkin underthe line: now, jerkin, you are like to lose yourhair and prove a bald jerkin.

TRINCULO

Do, do: we steal by line and level, an't like your grace.

STEPHANO

I thank thee for that jest; here's a garment for't:wit shall not go unrewarded while I am king of thiscountry. 'Steal by line and level' is an excellentpass of pate; there's another garment for't.

TRINCULO

Monster, come, put some lime upon your fingers, andaway with the rest.

CALIBAN

I will have none on't: we shall lose our time,And all be turn'd to barnacles, or to apesWith foreheads villanous low.

STEPHANO

Monster, lay-to your fingers: help to bear thisaway where my hogshead of wine is, or I'll turn youout of my kingdom: go to, carry this.

TRINCULO

And this.

STEPHANO

Ay, and this.A noise of hunters heard. Enter divers Spirits,  in shape of dogs and hounds, and hunt them about, PROSPERO and ARIEL setting them on


PROSPERO

Hey, Mountain, hey!

ARIEL

Silver I there it goes, Silver!

PROSPERO

Fury, Fury! there, Tyrant, there! hark! hark!CALIBAN, STEPHANO, and TRINCULO, are driven out
Go charge my goblins that they grind their jointsWith dry convulsions, shorten up their sinewsWith aged cramps, and more pinch-spotted make themThan pard or cat o' mountain.

ARIEL

Hark, they roar!

PROSPERO

Let them be hunted soundly. At this hourLie at my mercy all mine enemies:Shortly shall all my labours end, and thouShalt have the air at freedom: for a littleFollow, and do me service.Exeunt

ACT V
SCENE I. Before PROSPERO'S cell.

Enter PROSPERO in his magic robes, and ARIEL


PROSPERO

Now does my project gather to a head:My charms crack not; my spirits obey; and timeGoes upright with his carriage. How's the day?

ARIEL

On the sixth hour; at which time, my lord,You said our work should cease.

PROSPERO

I did say so,When first I raised the tempest. Say, my spirit,How fares the king and's followers?

ARIEL

Confined togetherIn the same fashion as you gave in charge,Just as you left them; all prisoners, sir,In the line-grove which weather-fends your cell;They cannot budge till your release. The king,His brother and yours, abide all three distractedAnd the remainder mourning over them,Brimful of sorrow and dismay; but chieflyHim that you term'd, sir, 'The good old lord Gonzalo;'His tears run down his beard, like winter's dropsFrom eaves of reeds. Your charm so strongly works 'emThat if you now beheld them, your affectionsWould become tender.

PROSPERO

Dost thou think so, spirit?

ARIEL

Mine would, sir, were I human.

PROSPERO

And mine shall.Hast thou, which art but air, a touch, a feelingOf their afflictions, and shall not myself,One of their kind, that relish all as sharply,Passion as they, be kindlier moved than thou art?Though with their high wrongs I am struck to the quick,Yet with my nobler reason 'gaitist my furyDo I take part: the rarer action isIn virtue than in vengeance: they being penitent,The sole drift of my purpose doth extendNot a frown further. Go release them, Ariel:My charms I'll break, their senses I'll restore,And they shall be themselves.

ARIEL

I'll fetch them, sir.Exit


PROSPERO

Ye elves of hills, brooks, standing lakes and groves,And ye that on the sands with printless footDo chase the ebbing Neptune and do fly himWhen he comes back; you demi-puppets thatBy moonshine do the green sour ringlets make,Whereof the ewe not bites, and you whose pastimeIs to make midnight mushrooms, that rejoiceTo hear the solemn curfew; by whose aid,Weak masters though ye be, I have bedimm'dThe noontide sun, call'd forth the mutinous winds,And 'twixt the green sea and the azured vaultSet roaring war: to the dread rattling thunderHave I given fire and rifted Jove's stout oakWith his own bolt; the strong-based promontoryHave I made shake and by the spurs pluck'd upThe pine and cedar: graves at my commandHave waked their sleepers, oped, and let 'em forthBy my so potent art. But this rough magicI here abjure, and, when I have requiredSome heavenly music, which even now I do,To work mine end upon their senses thatThis airy charm is for, I'll break my staff,Bury it certain fathoms in the earth,And deeper than did ever plummet soundI'll drown my book.Solemn music
Re-enter ARIEL before: then ALONSO, with a  frantic gesture, attended by GONZALO;  SEBASTIAN and ANTONIO in like manner,  attended by ADRIAN and FRANCISCO   they all  enter the circle which PROSPERO had made,  and there stand charmed; which PROSPERO observing, speaks:
A solemn air and the best comforterTo an unsettled fancy cure thy brains,Now useless, boil'd within thy skull! There stand,For you are spell-stopp'd.Holy Gonzalo, honourable man,Mine eyes, even sociable to the show of thine,Fall fellowly drops. The charm dissolves apace,And as the morning steals upon the night,Melting the darkness, so their rising sensesBegin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantleTheir clearer reason. O good Gonzalo,My true preserver, and a loyal sirTo him you follow'st! I will pay thy gracesHome both in word and deed. Most cruellyDidst thou, Alonso, use me and my daughter:Thy brother was a furtherer in the act.Thou art pinch'd fort now, Sebastian. Flesh and blood,You, brother mine, that entertain'd ambition,Expell'd remorse and nature; who, with Sebastian,Whose inward pinches therefore are most strong,Would here have kill'd your king; I do forgive thee,Unnatural though thou art. Their understandingBegins to swell, and the approaching tideWill shortly fill the reasonable shoreThat now lies foul and muddy. Not one of themThat yet looks on me, or would know me Ariel,Fetch me the hat and rapier in my cell:I will discase me, and myself presentAs I was sometime Milan: quickly, spirit;Thou shalt ere long be free.ARIEL sings and helps to attire him
Where the bee sucks. there suck I:In a cowslip's bell I lie;There I couch when owls do cry.On the bat's back I do flyAfter summer merrily.Merrily, merrily shall I live nowUnder the blossom that hangs on the bough.

PROSPERO

Why, that's my dainty Ariel! I shall miss thee:But yet thou shalt have freedom: so, so, so.To the king's ship, invisible as thou art:There shalt thou find the mariners asleepUnder the hatches; the master and the boatswainBeing awake, enforce them to this place,And presently, I prithee.

ARIEL

I drink the air before me, and returnOr ere your pulse twice beat.Exit


GONZALO

All torment, trouble, wonder and amazementInhabits here: some heavenly power guide usOut of this fearful country!

PROSPERO

Behold, sir king,The wronged Duke of Milan, Prospero:For more assurance that a living princeDoes now speak to thee, I embrace thy body;And to thee and thy company I bidA hearty welcome.

ALONSO

                  Whether thou best he or no,Or some enchanted trifle to abuse me,As late I have been, I not know: thy pulseBeats as of flesh and blood; and, since I saw thee,The affliction of my mind amends, with which,I fear, a madness held me: this must crave,An if this be at all, a most strange story.Thy dukedom I resign and do entreatThou pardon me my wrongs. But how should ProsperoBe living and be here?

PROSPERO

First, noble friend,Let me embrace thine age, whose honour cannotBe measured or confined.

GONZALO

Whether this beOr be not, I'll not swear.

PROSPERO

You do yet tasteSome subtilties o' the isle, that will not let youBelieve things certain. Welcome, my friends all!Aside to SEBASTIAN and ANTONIO
But you, my brace of lords, were I so minded,I here could pluck his highness' frown upon youAnd justify you traitors: at this timeI will tell no tales.

SEBASTIAN

[Aside]  The devil speaks in him.

PROSPERO

No.For you, most wicked sir, whom to call brotherWould even infect my mouth, I do forgiveThy rankest fault; all of them; and requireMy dukedom of thee, which perforce, I know,Thou must restore.

ALONSO

                  If thou be'st Prospero,Give us particulars of thy preservation;How thou hast met us here, who three hours sinceWere wreck'd upon this shore; where I have lost--How sharp the point of this remembrance is!--My dear son Ferdinand.

PROSPERO

I am woe for't, sir.

ALONSO

Irreparable is the loss, and patienceSays it is past her cure.

PROSPERO

I rather thinkYou have not sought her help, of whose soft graceFor the like loss I have her sovereign aidAnd rest myself content.

ALONSO

You the like loss!

PROSPERO

As great to me as late; and, supportableTo make the dear loss, have I means much weakerThan you may call to comfort you, for IHave lost my daughter.

ALONSO

A daughter?O heavens, that they were living both in Naples,The king and queen there! that they were, I wishMyself were mudded in that oozy bedWhere my son lies. When did you lose your daughter?

PROSPERO

In this last tempest. I perceive these lordsAt this encounter do so much admireThat they devour their reason and scarce thinkTheir eyes do offices of truth, their wordsAre natural breath: but, howsoe'er you haveBeen justled from your senses, know for certainThat I am Prospero and that very dukeWhich was thrust forth of Milan, who most strangelyUpon this shore, where you were wreck'd, was landed,To be the lord on't. No more yet of this;For 'tis a chronicle of day by day,Not a relation for a breakfast norBefitting this first meeting. Welcome, sir;This cell's my court: here have I few attendantsAnd subjects none abroad: pray you, look in.My dukedom since you have given me again,I will requite you with as good a thing;At least bring forth a wonder, to content yeAs much as me my dukedom.Here PROSPERO discovers FERDINAND and MIRANDA playing at chess


MIRANDA

Sweet lord, you play me false.

FERDINAND

No, my dear'st love,I would not for the world.

MIRANDA

Yes, for a score of kingdoms you should wrangle,And I would call it, fair play.

ALONSO

If this proveA vision of the Island, one dear sonShall I twice lose.

SEBASTIAN

A most high miracle!

FERDINAND

Though the seas threaten, they are merciful;I have cursed them without cause.Kneels


ALONSO

Now all the blessingsOf a glad father compass thee about!Arise, and say how thou camest here.

MIRANDA

O, wonder!How many goodly creatures are there here!How beauteous mankind is! O brave new world,That has such people in't!

PROSPERO

'Tis new to thee.

ALONSO

What is this maid with whom thou wast at play?Your eld'st acquaintance cannot be three hours:Is she the goddess that hath sever'd us,And brought us thus together?

FERDINAND

Sir, she is mortal;But by immortal Providence she's mine:I chose her when I could not ask my fatherFor his advice, nor thought I had one. SheIs daughter to this famous Duke of Milan,Of whom so often I have heard renown,But never saw before; of whom I haveReceived a second life; and second fatherThis lady makes him to me.

ALONSO

I am hers:But, O, how oddly will it sound that IMust ask my child forgiveness!

PROSPERO

There, sir, stop:Let us not burthen our remembrance withA heaviness that's gone.

GONZALO

I have inly wept,Or should have spoke ere this. Look down, you god,And on this couple drop a blessed crown!For it is you that have chalk'd forth the wayWhich brought us hither.

ALONSO

I say, Amen, Gonzalo!

GONZALO

Was Milan thrust from Milan, that his issueShould become kings of Naples? O, rejoiceBeyond a common joy, and set it downWith gold on lasting pillars: In one voyageDid Claribel her husband find at Tunis,And Ferdinand, her brother, found a wifeWhere he himself was lost, Prospero his dukedomIn a poor isle and all of us ourselvesWhen no man was his own.

ALONSO

[To FERDINAND and MIRANDA]  Give me your hands:Let grief and sorrow still embrace his heartThat doth not wish you joy!

GONZALO

Be it so! Amen!Re-enter ARIEL, with the Master and Boatswain amazedly following
O, look, sir, look, sir! here is more of us:I prophesied, if a gallows were on land,This fellow could not drown. Now, blasphemy,That swear'st grace o'erboard, not an oath on shore?Hast thou no mouth by land? What is the news?

Boatswain

The best news is, that we have safely foundOur king and company; the next, our ship--Which, but three glasses since, we gave out split--Is tight and yare and bravely rigg'd as whenWe first put out to sea.

ARIEL

[Aside to PROSPERO]  Sir, all this serviceHave I done since I went.

PROSPERO

[Aside to ARIEL]  My tricksy spirit!

ALONSO

These are not natural events; they strengthenFrom strange to stranger. Say, how came you hither?

Boatswain

If I did think, sir, I were well awake,I'ld strive to tell you. We were dead of sleep,And--how we know not--all clapp'd under hatches;Where but even now with strange and several noisesOf roaring, shrieking, howling, jingling chains,And more diversity of sounds, all horrible,We were awaked; straightway, at liberty;Where we, in all her trim, freshly beheldOur royal, good and gallant ship, our masterCapering to eye her: on a trice, so please you,Even in a dream, were we divided from themAnd were brought moping hither.

ARIEL

[Aside to PROSPERO]          Was't well done?

PROSPERO

[Aside to ARIEL]  Bravely, my diligence. Thou shalt be free.

ALONSO

This is as strange a maze as e'er men trodAnd there is in this business more than natureWas ever conduct of: some oracleMust rectify our knowledge.

PROSPERO

Sir, my liege,Do not infest your mind with beating onThe strangeness of this business; at pick'd leisureWhich shall be shortly, single I'll resolve you,Which to you shall seem probable, of everyThese happen'd accidents; till when, be cheerfulAnd think of each thing well.Aside to ARIEL
Come hither, spirit:Set Caliban and his companions free;Untie the spell.Exit ARIEL
How fares my gracious sir?There are yet missing of your companySome few odd lads that you remember not.Re-enter ARIEL, driving in CALIBAN, STEPHANO and TRINCULO, in their stolen apparel


STEPHANO

Every man shift for all the rest, andlet no man take care for himself; for all isbut fortune. Coragio, bully-monster, coragio!

TRINCULO

If these be true spies which I wear in my head,here's a goodly sight.

CALIBAN

O Setebos, these be brave spirits indeed!How fine my master is! I am afraidHe will chastise me.

SEBASTIAN

Ha, ha!What things are these, my lord Antonio?Will money buy 'em?

ANTONIO

Very like; one of themIs a plain fish, and, no doubt, marketable.

PROSPERO

Mark but the badges of these men, my lords,Then say if they be true. This mis-shapen knave,His mother was a witch, and one so strongThat could control the moon, make flows and ebbs,And deal in her command without her power.These three have robb'd me; and this demi-devil--For he's a bastard one--had plotted with themTo take my life. Two of these fellows youMust know and own; this thing of darkness!Acknowledge mine.

CALIBAN

                  I shall be pinch'd to death.

ALONSO

Is not this Stephano, my drunken butler?

SEBASTIAN

He is drunk now: where had he wine?

ALONSO

And Trinculo is reeling ripe: where should theyFind this grand liquor that hath gilded 'em?How camest thou in this pickle?

TRINCULO

I have been in such a pickle since Isaw you last that, I fear me, will never out ofmy bones: I shall not fear fly-blowing.

SEBASTIAN

Why, how now, Stephano!

STEPHANO

O, touch me not; I am not Stephano, but a cramp.

PROSPERO

You'ld be king o' the isle, sirrah?

STEPHANO

I should have been a sore one then.

ALONSO

This is a strange thing as e'er I look'd on.Pointing to Caliban


PROSPERO

He is as disproportion'd in his mannersAs in his shape. Go, sirrah, to my cell;Take with you your companions; as you lookTo have my pardon, trim it handsomely.

CALIBAN

Ay, that I will; and I'll be wise hereafterAnd seek for grace. What a thrice-double assWas I, to take this drunkard for a godAnd worship this dull fool!

PROSPERO

Go to; away!

ALONSO

Hence, and bestow your luggage where you found it.

SEBASTIAN

Or stole it, rather.Exeunt CALIBAN, STEPHANO, and TRINCULO


PROSPERO

Sir, I invite your highness and your trainTo my poor cell, where you shall take your restFor this one night; which, part of it, I'll wasteWith such discourse as, I not doubt, shall make itGo quick away; the story of my lifeAnd the particular accidents gone bySince I came to this isle: and in the mornI'll bring you to your ship and so to Naples,Where I have hope to see the nuptialOf these our dear-beloved solemnized;And thence retire me to my Milan, whereEvery third thought shall be my grave.

ALONSO

I longTo hear the story of your life, which mustTake the ear strangely.

PROSPERO

I'll deliver all;And promise you calm seas, auspicious galesAnd sail so expeditious that shall catchYour royal fleet far off.Aside to ARIEL
My Ariel, chick,That is thy charge: then to the elementsBe free, and fare thou well! Please you, draw near.Exeunt
EPILOGUESPOKEN BY PROSPERONow my charms are all o'erthrown,And what strength I have's mine own,Which is most faint: now, 'tis true,I must be here confined by you,Or sent to Naples. Let me not,Since I have my dukedom gotAnd pardon'd the deceiver, dwellIn this bare island by your spell;But release me from my bandsWith the help of your good hands:Gentle breath of yours my sailsMust fill, or else my project fails,Which was to please. Now I wantSpirits to enforce, art to enchant,And my ending is despair,Unless I be relieved by prayer,Which pierces so that it assaultsMercy itself and frees all faults.As you from crimes would pardon'd be,Let your indulgence set me free.
