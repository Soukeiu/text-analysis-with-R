ACT I
SCENE I. An apartment in the DUKE'S palace.

Enter DUKE VINCENTIO, ESCALUS, Lords and Attendants


DUKE VINCENTIO

Escalus.

ESCALUS

My lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO

Of government the properties to unfold,Would seem in me to affect speech and discourse;Since I am put to know that your own scienceExceeds, in that, the lists of all adviceMy strength can give you: then no more remains,But that to your sufficiency as your Worth is able,And let them work. The nature of our people,Our city's institutions, and the termsFor common justice, you're as pregnant inAs art and practise hath enriched anyThat we remember. There is our commission,From which we would not have you warp. Call hither,I say, bid come before us Angelo.Exit an Attendant
What figure of us think you he will bear?For you must know, we have with special soulElected him our absence to supply,Lent him our terror, dress'd him with our love,And given his deputation all the organsOf our own power: what think you of it?

ESCALUS

If any in Vienna be of worthTo undergo such ample grace and honour,It is Lord Angelo.

DUKE VINCENTIO

                  Look where he comes.Enter ANGELO


ANGELO

Always obedient to your grace's will,I come to know your pleasure.

DUKE VINCENTIO

Angelo,There is a kind of character in thy life,That to the observer doth thy historyFully unfold. Thyself and thy belongingsAre not thine own so proper as to wasteThyself upon thy virtues, they on thee.Heaven doth with us as we with torches do,Not light them for themselves; for if our virtuesDid not go forth of us, 'twere all alikeAs if we had them not. Spirits are not finely touch'dBut to fine issues, nor Nature never lendsThe smallest scruple of her excellenceBut, like a thrifty goddess, she determinesHerself the glory of a creditor,Both thanks and use. But I do bend my speechTo one that can my part in him advertise;Hold therefore, Angelo:--In our remove be thou at full ourself;Mortality and mercy in ViennaLive in thy tongue and heart: old Escalus,Though first in question, is thy secondary.Take thy commission.

ANGELO

Now, good my lord,Let there be some more test made of my metal,Before so noble and so great a figureBe stamp'd upon it.

DUKE VINCENTIO

No more evasion:We have with a leaven'd and prepared choiceProceeded to you; therefore take your honours.Our haste from hence is of so quick conditionThat it prefers itself and leaves unquestion'dMatters of needful value. We shall write to you,As time and our concernings shall importune,How it goes with us, and do look to knowWhat doth befall you here. So, fare you well;To the hopeful execution do I leave youOf your commissions.

ANGELO

Yet give leave, my lord,That we may bring you something on the way.

DUKE VINCENTIO

My haste may not admit it;Nor need you, on mine honour, have to doWith any scruple; your scope is as mine ownSo to enforce or qualify the lawsAs to your soul seems good. Give me your hand:I'll privily away. I love the people,But do not like to stage me to their eyes:Through it do well, I do not relish wellTheir loud applause and Aves vehement;Nor do I think the man of safe discretionThat does affect it. Once more, fare you well.

ANGELO

The heavens give safety to your purposes!

ESCALUS

Lead forth and bring you back in happiness!

DUKE

I thank you. Fare you well.Exit


ESCALUS

I shall desire you, sir, to give me leaveTo have free speech with you; and it concerns meTo look into the bottom of my place:A power I have, but of what strength and natureI am not yet instructed.

ANGELO

'Tis so with me. Let us withdraw together,And we may soon our satisfaction haveTouching that point.

ESCALUS

I'll wait upon your honour.Exeunt

SCENE II. A Street.

Enter LUCIO and two Gentlemen


LUCIO

If the duke with the other dukes come not tocomposition with the King of Hungary, why then allthe dukes fall upon the king.

First Gentleman

Heaven grant us its peace, but not the King ofHungary's!

Second Gentleman

Amen.

LUCIO

Thou concludest like the sanctimonious pirate, thatwent to sea with the Ten Commandments, but scrapedone out of the table.

Second Gentleman

'Thou shalt not steal'?

LUCIO

Ay, that he razed.

First Gentleman

Why, 'twas a commandment to command the captain andall the rest from their functions: they put forthto steal. There's not a soldier of us all, that, inthe thanksgiving before meat, do relish the petitionwell that prays for peace.

Second Gentleman

I never heard any soldier dislike it.

LUCIO

I believe thee; for I think thou never wast wheregrace was said.

Second Gentleman

No? a dozen times at least.

First Gentleman

What, in metre?

LUCIO

In any proportion or in any language.

First Gentleman

I think, or in any religion.

LUCIO

Ay, why not? Grace is grace, despite of allcontroversy: as, for example, thou thyself art awicked villain, despite of all grace.

First Gentleman

Well, there went but a pair of shears between us.

LUCIO

I grant; as there may between the lists and thevelvet. Thou art the list.

First Gentleman

And thou the velvet: thou art good velvet; thou'rta three-piled piece, I warrant thee: I had as liefbe a list of an English kersey as be piled, as thouart piled, for a French velvet. Do I speakfeelingly now?

LUCIO

I think thou dost; and, indeed, with most painfulfeeling of thy speech: I will, out of thine ownconfession, learn to begin thy health; but, whilst Ilive, forget to drink after thee.

First Gentleman

I think I have done myself wrong, have I not?

Second Gentleman

Yes, that thou hast, whether thou art tainted or free.

LUCIO

Behold, behold. where Madam Mitigation comes! Ihave purchased as many diseases under her roof as come to--

Second Gentleman

To what, I pray?

LUCIO

Judge.

Second Gentleman

To three thousand dolours a year.

First Gentleman

Ay, and more.

LUCIO

A French crown more.

First Gentleman

Thou art always figuring diseases in me; but thouart full of error; I am sound.

LUCIO

Nay, not as one would say, healthy; but so sound asthings that are hollow: thy bones are hollow;impiety has made a feast of thee.Enter MISTRESS OVERDONE


First Gentleman

How now! which of your hips has the most profound sciatica?

MISTRESS OVERDONE

Well, well; there's one yonder arrested and carriedto prison was worth five thousand of you all.

Second Gentleman

Who's that, I pray thee?

MISTRESS OVERDONE

Marry, sir, that's Claudio, Signior Claudio.

First Gentleman

Claudio to prison? 'tis not so.

MISTRESS OVERDONE

Nay, but I know 'tis so: I saw him arrested, sawhim carried away; and, which is more, within thesethree days his head to be chopped off.

LUCIO

But, after all this fooling, I would not have it so.Art thou sure of this?

MISTRESS OVERDONE

I am too sure of it: and it is for getting MadamJulietta with child.

LUCIO

Believe me, this may be: he promised to meet me twohours since, and he was ever precise inpromise-keeping.

Second Gentleman

Besides, you know, it draws something near to thespeech we had to such a purpose.

First Gentleman

But, most of all, agreeing with the proclamation.

LUCIO

Away! let's go learn the truth of it.Exeunt LUCIO and Gentlemen


MISTRESS OVERDONE

Thus, what with the war, what with the sweat, whatwith the gallows and what with poverty, I amcustom-shrunk.Enter POMPEY
How now! what's the news with you?

POMPEY

Yonder man is carried to prison.

MISTRESS OVERDONE

Well; what has he done?

POMPEY

A woman.

MISTRESS OVERDONE

But what's his offence?

POMPEY

Groping for trouts in a peculiar river.

MISTRESS OVERDONE

What, is there a maid with child by him?

POMPEY

No, but there's a woman with maid by him. You havenot heard of the proclamation, have you?

MISTRESS OVERDONE

What proclamation, man?

POMPEY

All houses in the suburbs of Vienna must be plucked down.

MISTRESS OVERDONE

And what shall become of those in the city?

POMPEY

They shall stand for seed: they had gone down too,but that a wise burgher put in for them.

MISTRESS OVERDONE

But shall all our houses of resort in the suburbs bepulled down?

POMPEY

To the ground, mistress.

MISTRESS OVERDONE

Why, here's a change indeed in the commonwealth!What shall become of me?

POMPEY

Come; fear you not: good counsellors lack noclients: though you change your place, you need notchange your trade; I'll be your tapster still.Courage! there will be pity taken on you: you thathave worn your eyes almost out in the service, youwill be considered.

MISTRESS OVERDONE

What's to do here, Thomas tapster? let's withdraw.

POMPEY

Here comes Signior Claudio, led by the provost toprison; and there's Madam Juliet.Exeunt
Enter Provost, CLAUDIO, JULIET, and Officers


CLAUDIO

Fellow, why dost thou show me thus to the world?Bear me to prison, where I am committed.

Provost

I do it not in evil disposition,But from Lord Angelo by special charge.

CLAUDIO

Thus can the demigod AuthorityMake us pay down for our offence by weightThe words of heaven; on whom it will, it will;On whom it will not, so; yet still 'tis just.Re-enter LUCIO and two Gentlemen


LUCIO

Why, how now, Claudio! whence comes this restraint?

CLAUDIO

From too much liberty, my Lucio, liberty:As surfeit is the father of much fast,So every scope by the immoderate useTurns to restraint. Our natures do pursue,Like rats that ravin down their proper bane,A thirsty evil; and when we drink we die.

LUCIO

If could speak so wisely under an arrest, I wouldsend for certain of my creditors: and yet, to saythe truth, I had as lief have the foppery of freedomas the morality of imprisonment. What's thyoffence, Claudio?

CLAUDIO

What but to speak of would offend again.

LUCIO

What, is't murder?

CLAUDIO

No.

LUCIO

Lechery?

CLAUDIO

Call it so.

Provost

Away, sir! you must go.

CLAUDIO

One word, good friend. Lucio, a word with you.

LUCIO

A hundred, if they'll do you any good.Is lechery so look'd after?

CLAUDIO

Thus stands it with me: upon a true contractI got possession of Julietta's bed:You know the lady; she is fast my wife,Save that we do the denunciation lackOf outward order: this we came not to,Only for propagation of a dowerRemaining in the coffer of her friends,From whom we thought it meet to hide our loveTill time had made them for us. But it chancesThe stealth of our most mutual entertainmentWith character too gross is writ on Juliet.

LUCIO

With child, perhaps?

CLAUDIO

Unhappily, even so.And the new deputy now for the duke--Whether it be the fault and glimpse of newness,Or whether that the body public beA horse whereon the governor doth ride,Who, newly in the seat, that it may knowHe can command, lets it straight feel the spur;Whether the tyranny be in his place,Or in his emmence that fills it up,I stagger in:--but this new governorAwakes me all the enrolled penaltiesWhich have, like unscour'd armour, hung by the wallSo long that nineteen zodiacs have gone roundAnd none of them been worn; and, for a name,Now puts the drowsy and neglected actFreshly on me: 'tis surely for a name.

LUCIO

I warrant it is: and thy head stands so tickle onthy shoulders that a milkmaid, if she be in love,may sigh it off. Send after the duke and appeal tohim.

CLAUDIO

I have done so, but he's not to be found.I prithee, Lucio, do me this kind service:This day my sister should the cloister enterAnd there receive her approbation:Acquaint her with the danger of my state:Implore her, in my voice, that she make friendsTo the strict deputy; bid herself assay him:I have great hope in that; for in her youthThere is a prone and speechless dialect,Such as move men; beside, she hath prosperous artWhen she will play with reason and discourse,And well she can persuade.

LUCIO

I pray she may; as well for the encouragement of thelike, which else would stand under grievousimposition, as for the enjoying of thy life, who Iwould be sorry should be thus foolishly lost at agame of tick-tack. I'll to her.

CLAUDIO

I thank you, good friend Lucio.

LUCIO

Within two hours.

CLAUDIO

                  Come, officer, away!Exeunt

SCENE III. A monastery.

Enter DUKE VINCENTIO and FRIAR THOMAS


DUKE VINCENTIO

No, holy father; throw away that thought;Believe not that the dribbling dart of loveCan pierce a complete bosom. Why I desire theeTo give me secret harbour, hath a purposeMore grave and wrinkled than the aims and endsOf burning youth.

FRIAR THOMAS

                  May your grace speak of it?

DUKE VINCENTIO

My holy sir, none better knows than youHow I have ever loved the life removedAnd held in idle price to haunt assembliesWhere youth, and cost, and witless bravery keeps.I have deliver'd to Lord Angelo,A man of stricture and firm abstinence,My absolute power and place here in Vienna,And he supposes me travell'd to Poland;For so I have strew'd it in the common ear,And so it is received. Now, pious sir,You will demand of me why I do this?

FRIAR THOMAS

Gladly, my lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO

We have strict statutes and most biting laws.The needful bits and curbs to headstrong weeds,Which for this nineteen years we have let slip;Even like an o'ergrown lion in a cave,That goes not out to prey. Now, as fond fathers,Having bound up the threatening twigs of birch,Only to stick it in their children's sightFor terror, not to use, in time the rodBecomes more mock'd than fear'd; so our decrees,Dead to infliction, to themselves are dead;And liberty plucks justice by the nose;The baby beats the nurse, and quite athwartGoes all decorum.

FRIAR THOMAS

                  It rested in your graceTo unloose this tied-up justice when you pleased:And it in you more dreadful would have seem'dThan in Lord Angelo.

DUKE VINCENTIO

I do fear, too dreadful:Sith 'twas my fault to give the people scope,'Twould be my tyranny to strike and gall themFor what I bid them do: for we bid this be done,When evil deeds have their permissive passAnd not the punishment. Therefore indeed, my father,I have on Angelo imposed the office;Who may, in the ambush of my name, strike home,And yet my nature never in the fightTo do in slander. And to behold his sway,I will, as 'twere a brother of your order,Visit both prince and people: therefore, I prithee,Supply me with the habit and instruct meHow I may formally in person bear meLike a true friar. More reasons for this actionAt our more leisure shall I render you;Only, this one: Lord Angelo is precise;Stands at a guard with envy; scarce confessesThat his blood flows, or that his appetiteIs more to bread than stone: hence shall we see,If power change purpose, what our seemers be.Exeunt

SCENE IV. A nunnery.

Enter ISABELLA and FRANCISCA


ISABELLA

And have you nuns no farther privileges?

FRANCISCA

Are not these large enough?

ISABELLA

Yes, truly; I speak not as desiring more;But rather wishing a more strict restraintUpon the sisterhood, the votarists of Saint Clare.

LUCIO

[Within]  Ho! Peace be in this place!

ISABELLA

Who's that which calls?

FRANCISCA

It is a man's voice. Gentle Isabella,Turn you the key, and know his business of him;You may, I may not; you are yet unsworn.When you have vow'd, you must not speak with menBut in the presence of the prioress:Then, if you speak, you must not show your face,Or, if you show your face, you must not speak.He calls again; I pray you, answer him.Exit


ISABELLA

Peace and prosperity! Who is't that callsEnter LUCIO


LUCIO

Hail, virgin, if you be, as those cheek-rosesProclaim you are no less! Can you so stead meAs bring me to the sight of Isabella,A novice of this place and the fair sisterTo her unhappy brother Claudio?

ISABELLA

Why 'her unhappy brother'? let me ask,The rather for I now must make you knowI am that Isabella and his sister.

LUCIO

Gentle and fair, your brother kindly greets you:Not to be weary with you, he's in prison.

ISABELLA

Woe me! for what?

LUCIO

For that which, if myself might be his judge,He should receive his punishment in thanks:He hath got his friend with child.

ISABELLA

Sir, make me not your story.

LUCIO

It is true.I would not--though 'tis my familiar sinWith maids to seem the lapwing and to jest,Tongue far from heart--play with all virgins so:I hold you as a thing ensky'd and sainted.By your renouncement an immortal spirit,And to be talk'd with in sincerity,As with a saint.

ISABELLA

You do blaspheme the good in mocking me.

LUCIO

Do not believe it. Fewness and truth, 'tis thus:Your brother and his lover have embraced:As those that feed grow full, as blossoming timeThat from the seedness the bare fallow bringsTo teeming foison, even so her plenteous wombExpresseth his full tilth and husbandry.

ISABELLA

Some one with child by him? My cousin Juliet?

LUCIO

Is she your cousin?

ISABELLA

Adoptedly; as school-maids change their namesBy vain though apt affection.

LUCIO

She it is.

ISABELLA

O, let him marry her.

LUCIO

This is the point.The duke is very strangely gone from hence;Bore many gentlemen, myself being one,In hand and hope of action: but we do learnBy those that know the very nerves of state,His givings-out were of an infinite distanceFrom his true-meant design. Upon his place,And with full line of his authority,Governs Lord Angelo; a man whose bloodIs very snow-broth; one who never feelsThe wanton stings and motions of the sense,But doth rebate and blunt his natural edgeWith profits of the mind, study and fast.He--to give fear to use and liberty,Which have for long run by the hideous law,As mice by lions--hath pick'd out an act,Under whose heavy sense your brother's lifeFalls into forfeit: he arrests him on it;And follows close the rigour of the statute,To make him an example. All hope is gone,Unless you have the grace by your fair prayerTo soften Angelo: and that's my pith of business'Twixt you and your poor brother.

ISABELLA

Doth he so seek his life?

LUCIO

Has censured himAlready; and, as I hear, the provost hathA warrant for his execution.

ISABELLA

Alas! what poor ability's in meTo do him good?

LUCIO

                  Assay the power you have.

ISABELLA

My power? Alas, I doubt--

LUCIO

Our doubts are traitorsAnd make us lose the good we oft might winBy fearing to attempt. Go to Lord Angelo,And let him learn to know, when maidens sue,Men give like gods; but when they weep and kneel,All their petitions are as freely theirsAs they themselves would owe them.

ISABELLA

I'll see what I can do.

LUCIO

But speedily.

ISABELLA

I will about it straight;No longer staying but to give the motherNotice of my affair. I humbly thank you:Commend me to my brother: soon at nightI'll send him certain word of my success.

LUCIO

I take my leave of you.

ISABELLA

Good sir, adieu.Exeunt

ACT II
SCENE I. A hall In ANGELO's house.

Enter ANGELO, ESCALUS, and a Justice, Provost, Officers, and other Attendants, behind


ANGELO

We must not make a scarecrow of the law,Setting it up to fear the birds of prey,And let it keep one shape, till custom make itTheir perch and not their terror.

ESCALUS

Ay, but yetLet us be keen, and rather cut a little,Than fall, and bruise to death. Alas, this gentlemanWhom I would save, had a most noble father!Let but your honour know,Whom I believe to be most strait in virtue,That, in the working of your own affections,Had time cohered with place or place with wishing,Or that the resolute acting of your bloodCould have attain'd the effect of your own purpose,Whether you had not sometime in your lifeErr'd in this point which now you censure him,And pull'd the law upon you.

ANGELO

'Tis one thing to be tempted, Escalus,Another thing to fall. I not deny,The jury, passing on the prisoner's life,May in the sworn twelve have a thief or twoGuiltier than him they try. What's open made to justice,That justice seizes: what know the lawsThat thieves do pass on thieves? 'Tis very pregnant,The jewel that we find, we stoop and take'tBecause we see it; but what we do not seeWe tread upon, and never think of it.You may not so extenuate his offenceFor I have had such faults; but rather tell me,When I, that censure him, do so offend,Let mine own judgment pattern out my death,And nothing come in partial. Sir, he must die.

ESCALUS

Be it as your wisdom will.

ANGELO

Where is the provost?

Provost

Here, if it like your honour.

ANGELO

See that ClaudioBe executed by nine to-morrow morning:Bring him his confessor, let him be prepared;For that's the utmost of his pilgrimage.Exit Provost


ESCALUS

[Aside]  Well, heaven forgive him! and forgive us all!Some rise by sin, and some by virtue fall:Some run from brakes of ice, and answer none:And some condemned for a fault alone.Enter ELBOW, and Officers with FROTH and POMPEY


ELBOW

Come, bring them away: if these be good people ina commonweal that do nothing but use their abuses incommon houses, I know no law: bring them away.

ANGELO

How now, sir! What's your name? and what's the matter?

ELBOW

If it Please your honour, I am the poor duke'sconstable, and my name is Elbow: I do lean uponjustice, sir, and do bring in here before your goodhonour two notorious benefactors.

ANGELO

Benefactors? Well; what benefactors are they? arethey not malefactors?

ELBOW

If it? please your honour, I know not well what theyare: but precise villains they are, that I am sureof; and void of all profanation in the world thatgood Christians ought to have.

ESCALUS

This comes off well; here's a wise officer.

ANGELO

Go to: what quality are they of? Elbow is yourname? why dost thou not speak, Elbow?

POMPEY

He cannot, sir; he's out at elbow.

ANGELO

What are you, sir?

ELBOW

He, sir! a tapster, sir; parcel-bawd; one thatserves a bad woman; whose house, sir, was, as theysay, plucked down in the suburbs; and now sheprofesses a hot-house, which, I think, is a very ill house too.

ESCALUS

How know you that?

ELBOW

My wife, sir, whom I detest before heaven and your honour,--

ESCALUS

How? thy wife?

ELBOW

Ay, sir; whom, I thank heaven, is an honest woman,--

ESCALUS

Dost thou detest her therefore?

ELBOW

I say, sir, I will detest myself also, as well asshe, that this house, if it be not a bawd's house,it is pity of her life, for it is a naughty house.

ESCALUS

How dost thou know that, constable?

ELBOW

Marry, sir, by my wife; who, if she had been a womancardinally given, might have been accused infornication, adultery, and all uncleanliness there.

ESCALUS

By the woman's means?

ELBOW

Ay, sir, by Mistress Overdone's means: but as shespit in his face, so she defied him.

POMPEY

Sir, if it please your honour, this is not so.

ELBOW

Prove it before these varlets here, thou honourableman; prove it.

ESCALUS

Do you hear how he misplaces?

POMPEY

Sir, she came in great with child; and longing,saving your honour's reverence, for stewed prunes;sir, we had but two in the house, which at that verydistant time stood, as it were, in a fruit-dish, adish of some three-pence; your honours have seensuch dishes; they are not China dishes, but verygood dishes,--

ESCALUS

Go to, go to: no matter for the dish, sir.

POMPEY

No, indeed, sir, not of a pin; you are therein inthe right: but to the point. As I say, thisMistress Elbow, being, as I say, with child, andbeing great-bellied, and longing, as I said, forprunes; and having but two in the dish, as I said,Master Froth here, this very man, having eaten therest, as I said, and, as I say, paying for them veryhonestly; for, as you know, Master Froth, I couldnot give you three-pence again.

FROTH

No, indeed.

POMPEY

Very well: you being then, if you be remembered,cracking the stones of the foresaid prunes,--

FROTH

Ay, so I did indeed.

POMPEY

Why, very well; I telling you then, if you beremembered, that such a one and such a one were pastcure of the thing you wot of, unless they kept verygood diet, as I told you,--

FROTH

All this is true.

POMPEY

Why, very well, then,--

ESCALUS

Come, you are a tedious fool: to the purpose. Whatwas done to Elbow's wife, that he hath cause tocomplain of? Come me to what was done to her.

POMPEY

Sir, your honour cannot come to that yet.

ESCALUS

No, sir, nor I mean it not.

POMPEY

Sir, but you shall come to it, by your honour'sleave. And, I beseech you, look into Master Frothhere, sir; a man of four-score pound a year; whosefather died at Hallowmas: was't not at Hallowmas,Master Froth?

FROTH

All-hallond eve.

POMPEY

Why, very well; I hope here be truths. He, sir,sitting, as I say, in a lower chair, sir; 'twas inthe Bunch of Grapes, where indeed you have a delightto sit, have you not?

FROTH

I have so; because it is an open room and good for winter.

POMPEY

Why, very well, then; I hope here be truths.

ANGELO

This will last out a night in Russia,When nights are longest there: I'll take my leave.And leave you to the hearing of the cause;Hoping you'll find good cause to whip them all.

ESCALUS

I think no less. Good morrow to your lordship.Exit ANGELO
Now, sir, come on: what was done to Elbow's wife, once more?

POMPEY

Once, sir? there was nothing done to her once.

ELBOW

I beseech you, sir, ask him what this man did to my wife.

POMPEY

I beseech your honour, ask me.

ESCALUS

Well, sir; what did this gentleman to her?

POMPEY

I beseech you, sir, look in this gentleman's face.Good Master Froth, look upon his honour; 'tis for agood purpose. Doth your honour mark his face?

ESCALUS

Ay, sir, very well.

POMPEY

Nay; I beseech you, mark it well.

ESCALUS

Well, I do so.

POMPEY

Doth your honour see any harm in his face?

ESCALUS

Why, no.

POMPEY

I'll be supposed upon a book, his face is the worstthing about him. Good, then; if his face be theworst thing about him, how could Master Froth do theconstable's wife any harm? I would know that ofyour honour.

ESCALUS

He's in the right. Constable, what say you to it?

ELBOW

First, an it like you, the house is a respectedhouse; next, this is a respected fellow; and hismistress is a respected woman.

POMPEY

By this hand, sir, his wife is a more respectedperson than any of us all.

ELBOW

Varlet, thou liest; thou liest, wicked varlet! thetime has yet to come that she was ever respectedwith man, woman, or child.

POMPEY

Sir, she was respected with him before he married with her.

ESCALUS

Which is the wiser here? Justice or Iniquity? Isthis true?

ELBOW

O thou caitiff! O thou varlet! O thou wickedHannibal! I respected with her before I was marriedto her! If ever I was respected with her, or shewith me, let not your worship think me the poorduke's officer. Prove this, thou wicked Hannibal, orI'll have mine action of battery on thee.

ESCALUS

If he took you a box o' the ear, you might have youraction of slander too.

ELBOW

Marry, I thank your good worship for it. What is'tyour worship's pleasure I shall do with this wicked caitiff?

ESCALUS

Truly, officer, because he hath some offences in himthat thou wouldst discover if thou couldst, let himcontinue in his courses till thou knowest what theyare.

ELBOW

Marry, I thank your worship for it. Thou seest, thouwicked varlet, now, what's come upon thee: thou artto continue now, thou varlet; thou art to continue.

ESCALUS

Where were you born, friend?

FROTH

Here in Vienna, sir.

ESCALUS

Are you of fourscore pounds a year?

FROTH

Yes, an't please you, sir.

ESCALUS

So. What trade are you of, sir?

POMPHEY

Tapster; a poor widow's tapster.

ESCALUS

Your mistress' name?

POMPHEY

Mistress Overdone.

ESCALUS

Hath she had any more than one husband?

POMPEY

Nine, sir; Overdone by the last.

ESCALUS

Nine! Come hither to me, Master Froth. MasterFroth, I would not have you acquainted withtapsters: they will draw you, Master Froth, and youwill hang them. Get you gone, and let me hear nomore of you.

FROTH

I thank your worship. For mine own part, I nevercome into any room in a tap-house, but I am drawnin.

ESCALUS

Well, no more of it, Master Froth: farewell.Exit FROTH
Come you hither to me, Master tapster. What's yourname, Master tapster?

POMPEY

Pompey.

ESCALUS

What else?

POMPEY

Bum, sir.

ESCALUS

Troth, and your bum is the greatest thing about you;so that in the beastliest sense you are Pompey theGreat. Pompey, you are partly a bawd, Pompey,howsoever you colour it in being a tapster, are younot? come, tell me true: it shall be the better for you.

POMPEY

Truly, sir, I am a poor fellow that would live.

ESCALUS

How would you live, Pompey? by being a bawd? Whatdo you think of the trade, Pompey? is it a lawful trade?

POMPEY

If the law would allow it, sir.

ESCALUS

But the law will not allow it, Pompey; nor it shallnot be allowed in Vienna.

POMPEY

Does your worship mean to geld and splay all theyouth of the city?

ESCALUS

No, Pompey.

POMPEY

Truly, sir, in my poor opinion, they will to't then.If your worship will take order for the drabs andthe knaves, you need not to fear the bawds.

ESCALUS

There are pretty orders beginning, I can tell you:it is but heading and hanging.

POMPEY

If you head and hang all that offend that way butfor ten year together, you'll be glad to give out acommission for more heads: if this law hold inVienna ten year, I'll rent the fairest house in itafter three-pence a bay: if you live to see thiscome to pass, say Pompey told you so.

ESCALUS

Thank you, good Pompey; and, in requital of yourprophecy, hark you: I advise you, let me not findyou before me again upon any complaint whatsoever;no, not for dwelling where you do: if I do, Pompey,I shall beat you to your tent, and prove a shrewdCaesar to you; in plain dealing, Pompey, I shallhave you whipt: so, for this time, Pompey, fare you well.

POMPEY

I thank your worship for your good counsel:Aside
but I shall follow it as the flesh and fortune shallbetter determine.Whip me? No, no; let carman whip his jade:The valiant heart is not whipt out of his trade.Exit


ESCALUS

Come hither to me, Master Elbow; come hither, Masterconstable. How long have you been in this place of constable?

ELBOW

Seven year and a half, sir.

ESCALUS

I thought, by your readiness in the office, you hadcontinued in it some time. You say, seven years together?

ELBOW

And a half, sir.

ESCALUS

Alas, it hath been great pains to you. They do youwrong to put you so oft upon 't: are there not menin your ward sufficient to serve it?

ELBOW

Faith, sir, few of any wit in such matters: as theyare chosen, they are glad to choose me for them; Ido it for some piece of money, and go through withall.

ESCALUS

Look you bring me in the names of some six or seven,the most sufficient of your parish.

ELBOW

To your worship's house, sir?

ESCALUS

To my house. Fare you well.Exit ELBOW
What's o'clock, think you?

Justice

Eleven, sir.

ESCALUS

I pray you home to dinner with me.

Justice

I humbly thank you.

ESCALUS

It grieves me for the death of Claudio;But there's no remedy.

Justice

Lord Angelo is severe.

ESCALUS

It is but needful:Mercy is not itself, that oft looks so;Pardon is still the nurse of second woe:But yet,--poor Claudio! There is no remedy.Come, sir.Exeunt

SCENE II. Another room in the same.

Enter Provost and a Servant


Servant

He's hearing of a cause; he will come straightI'll tell him of you.

Provost

Pray you, do.Exit Servant
I'll knowHis pleasure; may be he will relent. Alas,He hath but as offended in a dream!All sects, all ages smack of this vice; and heTo die for't!Enter ANGELO


ANGELO

                  Now, what's the matter. Provost?

Provost

Is it your will Claudio shall die tomorrow?

ANGELO

Did not I tell thee yea? hadst thou not order?Why dost thou ask again?

Provost

Lest I might be too rash:Under your good correction, I have seen,When, after execution, judgment hathRepented o'er his doom.

ANGELO

Go to; let that be mine:Do you your office, or give up your place,And you shall well be spared.

Provost

I crave your honour's pardon.What shall be done, sir, with the groaning Juliet?She's very near her hour.

ANGELO

Dispose of herTo some more fitter place, and that with speed.Re-enter Servant


Servant

Here is the sister of the man condemn'dDesires access to you.

ANGELO

Hath he a sister?

Provost

Ay, my good lord; a very virtuous maid,And to be shortly of a sisterhood,If not already.

ANGELO

                  Well, let her be admitted.Exit Servant
See you the fornicatress be removed:Let have needful, but not lavish, means;There shall be order for't.Enter ISABELLA and LUCIO


Provost

God save your honour!

ANGELO

Stay a little while.To ISABELLA
You're welcome: what's your will?

ISABELLA

I am a woeful suitor to your honour,Please but your honour hear me.

ANGELO

Well; what's your suit?

ISABELLA

There is a vice that most I do abhor,And most desire should meet the blow of justice;For which I would not plead, but that I must;For which I must not plead, but that I amAt war 'twixt will and will not.

ANGELO

Well; the matter?

ISABELLA

I have a brother is condemn'd to die:I do beseech you, let it be his fault,And not my brother.

Provost

[Aside]  Heaven give thee moving graces!

ANGELO

Condemn the fault and not the actor of it?Why, every fault's condemn'd ere it be done:Mine were the very cipher of a function,To fine the faults whose fine stands in record,And let go by the actor.

ISABELLA

O just but severe law!I had a brother, then. Heaven keep your honour!

LUCIO

[Aside to ISABELLA]  Give't not o'er so: to himagain, entreat him;Kneel down before him, hang upon his gown:You are too cold; if you should need a pin,You could not with more tame a tongue desire it:To him, I say!

ISABELLA

Must he needs die?

ANGELO

                  Maiden, no remedy.

ISABELLA

Yes; I do think that you might pardon him,And neither heaven nor man grieve at the mercy.

ANGELO

I will not do't.

ISABELLA

                  But can you, if you would?

ANGELO

Look, what I will not, that I cannot do.

ISABELLA

But might you do't, and do the world no wrong,If so your heart were touch'd with that remorseA s mine is to him?

ANGELO

                  He's sentenced; 'tis too late.

LUCIO

[Aside to ISABELLA]  You are too cold.

ISABELLA

Too late? why, no; I, that do speak a word.May call it back again. Well, believe this,No ceremony that to great ones 'longs,Not the king's crown, nor the deputed sword,The marshal's truncheon, nor the judge's robe,Become them with one half so good a graceAs mercy does.If he had been as you and you as he,You would have slipt like him; but he, like you,Would not have been so stern.

ANGELO

Pray you, be gone.

ISABELLA

I would to heaven I had your potency,And you were Isabel! should it then be thus?No; I would tell what 'twere to be a judge,And what a prisoner.

LUCIO

[Aside to ISABELLA]Ay, touch him; there's the vein.

ANGELO

Your brother is a forfeit of the law,And you but waste your words.

ISABELLA

Alas, alas!Why, all the souls that were were forfeit once;And He that might the vantage best have tookFound out the remedy. How would you be,If He, which is the top of judgment, shouldBut judge you as you are? O, think on that;And mercy then will breathe within your lips,Like man new made.

ANGELO

                  Be you content, fair maid;It is the law, not I condemn your brother:Were he my kinsman, brother, or my son,It should be thus with him: he must die tomorrow.

ISABELLA

To-morrow! O, that's sudden! Spare him, spare him!He's not prepared for death. Even for our kitchensWe kill the fowl of season: shall we serve heavenWith less respect than we do ministerTo our gross selves? Good, good my lord, bethink you;Who is it that hath died for this offence?There's many have committed it.

LUCIO

[Aside to ISABELLA]           Ay, well said.

ANGELO

The law hath not been dead, though it hath slept:Those many had not dared to do that evil,If the first that did the edict infringeHad answer'd for his deed: now 'tis awakeTakes note of what is done; and, like a prophet,Looks in a glass, that shows what future evils,Either new, or by remissness new-conceived,And so in progress to be hatch'd and born,Are now to have no successive degrees,But, ere they live, to end.

ISABELLA

Yet show some pity.

ANGELO

I show it most of all when I show justice;For then I pity those I do not know,Which a dismiss'd offence would after gall;And do him right that, answering one foul wrong,Lives not to act another. Be satisfied;Your brother dies to-morrow; be content.

ISABELLA

So you must be the first that gives this sentence,And he, that suffer's. O, it is excellentTo have a giant's strength; but it is tyrannousTo use it like a giant.

LUCIO

[Aside to ISABELLA]   That's well said.

ISABELLA

Could great men thunderAs Jove himself does, Jove would ne'er be quiet,For every pelting, petty officerWould use his heaven for thunder;Nothing but thunder! Merciful Heaven,Thou rather with thy sharp and sulphurous boltSplit'st the unwedgeable and gnarled oakThan the soft myrtle: but man, proud man,Drest in a little brief authority,Most ignorant of what he's most assured,His glassy essence, like an angry ape,Plays such fantastic tricks before high heavenAs make the angels weep; who, with our spleens,Would all themselves laugh mortal.

LUCIO

[Aside to ISABELLA]  O, to him, to him, wench! hewill relent;He's coming; I perceive 't.

Provost

[Aside]  Pray heaven she win him!

ISABELLA

We cannot weigh our brother with ourself:Great men may jest with saints; 'tis wit in them,But in the less foul profanation.

LUCIO

Thou'rt i' the right, girl; more o, that.

ISABELLA

That in the captain's but a choleric word,Which in the soldier is flat blasphemy.

LUCIO

[Aside to ISABELLA]  Art avised o' that? more on 't.

ANGELO

Why do you put these sayings upon me?

ISABELLA

Because authority, though it err like others,Hath yet a kind of medicine in itself,That skins the vice o' the top. Go to your bosom;Knock there, and ask your heart what it doth knowThat's like my brother's fault: if it confessA natural guiltiness such as is his,Let it not sound a thought upon your tongueAgainst my brother's life.

ANGELO

[Aside]                  She speaks, and 'tisSuch sense, that my sense breeds with it. Fare you well.

ISABELLA

Gentle my lord, turn back.

ANGELO

I will bethink me: come again tomorrow.

ISABELLA

Hark how I'll bribe you: good my lord, turn back.

ANGELO

How! bribe me?

ISABELLA

Ay, with such gifts that heaven shall share with you.

LUCIO

[Aside to ISABELLA]  You had marr'd all else.

ISABELLA

Not with fond shekels of the tested gold,Or stones whose rates are either rich or poorAs fancy values them; but with true prayersThat shall be up at heaven and enter thereEre sun-rise, prayers from preserved souls,From fasting maids whose minds are dedicateTo nothing temporal.

ANGELO

Well; come to me to-morrow.

LUCIO

[Aside to ISABELLA]  Go to; 'tis well; away!

ISABELLA

Heaven keep your honour safe!

ANGELO

[Aside]	Amen:For I am that way going to temptation,Where prayers cross.

ISABELLA

At what hour to-morrowShall I attend your lordship?

ANGELO

At any time 'fore noon.

ISABELLA

'Save your honour!Exeunt ISABELLA, LUCIO, and Provost


ANGELO

                  From thee, even from thy virtue!What's this, what's this? Is this her fault or mine?The tempter or the tempted, who sins most?Ha!Not she: nor doth she tempt: but it is IThat, lying by the violet in the sun,Do as the carrion does, not as the flower,Corrupt with virtuous season. Can it beThat modesty may more betray our senseThan woman's lightness? Having waste ground enough,Shall we desire to raze the sanctuaryAnd pitch our evils there? O, fie, fie, fie!What dost thou, or what art thou, Angelo?Dost thou desire her foully for those thingsThat make her good? O, let her brother live!Thieves for their robbery have authorityWhen judges steal themselves. What, do I love her,That I desire to hear her speak again,And feast upon her eyes? What is't I dream on?O cunning enemy, that, to catch a saint,With saints dost bait thy hook! Most dangerousIs that temptation that doth goad us onTo sin in loving virtue: never could the strumpet,With all her double vigour, art and nature,Once stir my temper; but this virtuous maidSubdues me quite. Even till now,When men were fond, I smiled and wonder'd how.Exit

SCENE III. A room in a prison.

Enter, severally, DUKE VINCENTIO disguised as a friar, and Provost


DUKE VINCENTIO

Hail to you, provost! so I think you are.

Provost

I am the provost. What's your will, good friar?

DUKE VINCENTIO

Bound by my charity and my blest order,I come to visit the afflicted spiritsHere in the prison. Do me the common rightTo let me see them and to make me knowThe nature of their crimes, that I may ministerTo them accordingly.

Provost

I would do more than that, if more were needful.Enter JULIET
Look, here comes one: a gentlewoman of mine,Who, falling in the flaws of her own youth,Hath blister'd her report: she is with child;And he that got it, sentenced; a young manMore fit to do another such offenceThan die for this.

DUKE VINCENTIO

When must he die?

Provost

                  As I do think, to-morrow.I have provided for you: stay awhile,To JULIET
And you shall be conducted.

DUKE VINCENTIO

Repent you, fair one, of the sin you carry?

JULIET

I do; and bear the shame most patiently.

DUKE VINCENTIO

I'll teach you how you shall arraign your conscience,And try your penitence, if it be sound,Or hollowly put on.

JULIET

I'll gladly learn.

DUKE VINCENTIO

Love you the man that wrong'd you?

JULIET

Yes, as I love the woman that wrong'd him.

DUKE VINCENTIO

So then it seems your most offenceful actWas mutually committed?

JULIET

Mutually.

DUKE VINCENTIO

Then was your sin of heavier kind than his.

JULIET

I do confess it, and repent it, father.

DUKE VINCENTIO

'Tis meet so, daughter: but lest you do repent,As that the sin hath brought you to this shame,Which sorrow is always towards ourselves, not heaven,Showing we would not spare heaven as we love it,But as we stand in fear,--

JULIET

I do repent me, as it is an evil,And take the shame with joy.

DUKE VINCENTIO

There rest.Your partner, as I hear, must die to-morrow,And I am going with instruction to him.Grace go with you, Benedicite!Exit


JULIET

Must die to-morrow! O injurious love,That respites me a life, whose very comfortIs still a dying horror!

Provost

'Tis pity of him.Exeunt

SCENE IV. A room in ANGELO's house.

Enter ANGELO


ANGELO

When I would pray and think, I think and prayTo several subjects. Heaven hath my empty words;Whilst my invention, hearing not my tongue,Anchors on Isabel: Heaven in my mouth,As if I did but only chew his name;And in my heart the strong and swelling evilOf my conception. The state, whereon I studiedIs like a good thing, being often read,Grown fear'd and tedious; yea, my gravity,Wherein--let no man hear me--I take pride,Could I with boot change for an idle plume,Which the air beats for vain. O place, O form,How often dost thou with thy case, thy habit,Wrench awe from fools and tie the wiser soulsTo thy false seeming! Blood, thou art blood:Let's write good angel on the devil's horn:'Tis not the devil's crest.Enter a Servant
How now! who's there?

Servant

One Isabel, a sister, desires access to you.

ANGELO

Teach her the way.Exit Servant
O heavens!Why does my blood thus muster to my heart,Making both it unable for itself,And dispossessing all my other partsOf necessary fitness?So play the foolish throngs with one that swoons;Come all to help him, and so stop the airBy which he should revive: and even soThe general, subject to a well-wish'd king,Quit their own part, and in obsequious fondnessCrowd to his presence, where their untaught loveMust needs appear offence.Enter ISABELLA
How now, fair maid?

ISABELLA

I am come to know your pleasure.

ANGELO

That you might know it, would much better please meThan to demand what 'tis. Your brother cannot live.

ISABELLA

Even so. Heaven keep your honour!

ANGELO

Yet may he live awhile; and, it may be,

As long as you or I

yet he must die.

ISABELLA

Under your sentence?

ANGELO

Yea.

ISABELLA

When, I beseech you? that in his reprieve,Longer or shorter, he may be so fittedThat his soul sicken not.

ANGELO

Ha! fie, these filthy vices! It were as goodTo pardon him that hath from nature stolenA man already made, as to remitTheir saucy sweetness that do coin heaven's imageIn stamps that are forbid: 'tis all as easyFalsely to take away a life true madeAs to put metal in restrained meansTo make a false one.

ISABELLA

'Tis set down so in heaven, but not in earth.

ANGELO

Say you so? then I shall pose you quickly.Which had you rather, that the most just lawNow took your brother's life; or, to redeem him,Give up your body to such sweet uncleannessAs she that he hath stain'd?

ISABELLA

Sir, believe this,I had rather give my body than my soul.

ANGELO

I talk not of your soul: our compell'd sinsStand more for number than for accompt.

ISABELLA

How say you?

ANGELO

Nay, I'll not warrant that; for I can speakAgainst the thing I say. Answer to this:I, now the voice of the recorded law,Pronounce a sentence on your brother's life:Might there not be a charity in sinTo save this brother's life?

ISABELLA

Please you to do't,I'll take it as a peril to my soul,It is no sin at all, but charity.

ANGELO

Pleased you to do't at peril of your soul,Were equal poise of sin and charity.

ISABELLA

That I do beg his life, if it be sin,Heaven let me bear it! you granting of my suit,If that be sin, I'll make it my morn prayerTo have it added to the faults of mine,And nothing of your answer.

ANGELO

Nay, but hear me.Your sense pursues not mine: either you are ignorant,Or seem so craftily; and that's not good.

ISABELLA

Let me be ignorant, and in nothing good,But graciously to know I am no better.

ANGELO

Thus wisdom wishes to appear most brightWhen it doth tax itself; as these black masksProclaim an enshield beauty ten times louderThan beauty could, display'd. But mark me;To be received plain, I'll speak more gross:Your brother is to die.

ISABELLA

So.

ANGELO

And his offence is so, as it appears,Accountant to the law upon that pain.

ISABELLA

True.

ANGELO

Admit no other way to save his life,--As I subscribe not that, nor any other,But in the loss of question,--that you, his sister,Finding yourself desired of such a person,Whose credit with the judge, or own great place,Could fetch your brother from the manaclesOf the all-building law; and that there wereNo earthly mean to save him, but that eitherYou must lay down the treasures of your bodyTo this supposed, or else to let him suffer;What would you do?

ISABELLA

As much for my poor brother as myself:That is, were I under the terms of death,The impression of keen whips I'ld wear as rubies,And strip myself to death, as to a bedThat longing have been sick for, ere I'ld yieldMy body up to shame.

ANGELO

Then must your brother die.

ISABELLA

And 'twere the cheaper way:Better it were a brother died at once,Than that a sister, by redeeming him,Should die for ever.

ANGELO

Were not you then as cruel as the sentenceThat you have slander'd so?

ISABELLA

Ignomy in ransom and free pardonAre of two houses: lawful mercyIs nothing kin to foul redemption.

ANGELO

You seem'd of late to make the law a tyrant;And rather proved the sliding of your brotherA merriment than a vice.

ISABELLA

O, pardon me, my lord; it oft falls out,To have what we would have, we speak not what we mean:I something do excuse the thing I hate,For his advantage that I dearly love.

ANGELO

We are all frail.

ISABELLA

                  Else let my brother die,If not a feodary, but only heOwe and succeed thy weakness.

ANGELO

Nay, women are frail too.

ISABELLA

Ay, as the glasses where they view themselves;Which are as easy broke as they make forms.Women! Help Heaven! men their creation marIn profiting by them. Nay, call us ten times frail;For we are soft as our complexions are,And credulous to false prints.

ANGELO

I think it well:And from this testimony of your own sex,--Since I suppose we are made to be no strongerThan faults may shake our frames,--let me be bold;I do arrest your words. Be that you are,That is, a woman; if you be more, you're none;If you be one, as you are well express'dBy all external warrants, show it now,By putting on the destined livery.

ISABELLA

I have no tongue but one: gentle my lord,Let me entreat you speak the former language.

ANGELO

Plainly conceive, I love you.

ISABELLA

My brother did love Juliet,And you tell me that he shall die for it.

ANGELO

He shall not, Isabel, if you give me love.

ISABELLA

I know your virtue hath a licence in't,Which seems a little fouler than it is,To pluck on others.

ANGELO

Believe me, on mine honour,My words express my purpose.

ISABELLA

Ha! little honour to be much believed,And most pernicious purpose! Seeming, seeming!I will proclaim thee, Angelo; look for't:Sign me a present pardon for my brother,Or with an outstretch'd throat I'll tell the world aloudWhat man thou art.

ANGELO

                  Who will believe thee, Isabel?My unsoil'd name, the austereness of my life,My vouch against you, and my place i' the state,Will so your accusation overweigh,That you shall stifle in your own reportAnd smell of calumny. I have begun,And now I give my sensual race the rein:Fit thy consent to my sharp appetite;Lay by all nicety and prolixious blushes,That banish what they sue for; redeem thy brotherBy yielding up thy body to my will;Or else he must not only die the death,But thy unkindness shall his death draw outTo lingering sufferance. Answer me to-morrow,Or, by the affection that now guides me most,I'll prove a tyrant to him. As for you,Say what you can, my false o'erweighs your true.Exit


ISABELLA

To whom should I complain? Did I tell this,Who would believe me? O perilous mouths,That bear in them one and the self-same tongue,Either of condemnation or approof;Bidding the law make court'sy to their will:Hooking both right and wrong to the appetite,To follow as it draws! I'll to my brother:Though he hath fallen by prompture of the blood,Yet hath he in him such a mind of honour.That, had he twenty heads to tender downOn twenty bloody blocks, he'ld yield them up,Before his sister should her body stoopTo such abhorr'd pollution.Then, Isabel, live chaste, and, brother, die:More than our brother is our chastity.I'll tell him yet of Angelo's request,And fit his mind to death, for his soul's rest.Exit

ACT III
SCENE I. A room in the prison.

Enter DUKE VINCENTIO disguised as before, CLAUDIO, and Provost


DUKE VINCENTIO

So then you hope of pardon from Lord Angelo?

CLAUDIO

The miserable have no other medicineBut only hope:I've hope to live, and am prepared to die.

DUKE VINCENTIO

Be absolute for death; either death or lifeShall thereby be the sweeter. Reason thus with life:If I do lose thee, I do lose a thingThat none but fools would keep: a breath thou art,Servile to all the skyey influences,That dost this habitation, where thou keep'st,Hourly afflict: merely, thou art death's fool;For him thou labour'st by thy flight to shunAnd yet runn'st toward him still. Thou art not noble;For all the accommodations that thou bear'stAre nursed by baseness. Thou'rt by no means valiant;For thou dost fear the soft and tender forkOf a poor worm. Thy best of rest is sleep,And that thou oft provokest; yet grossly fear'stThy death, which is no more. Thou art not thyself;For thou exist'st on many a thousand grainsThat issue out of dust. Happy thou art not;For what thou hast not, still thou strivest to get,And what thou hast, forget'st. Thou art not certain;For thy complexion shifts to strange effects,After the moon. If thou art rich, thou'rt poor;For, like an ass whose back with ingots bows,Thou bear's thy heavy riches but a journey,And death unloads thee. Friend hast thou none;For thine own bowels, which do call thee sire,The mere effusion of thy proper loins,Do curse the gout, serpigo, and the rheum,For ending thee no sooner. Thou hast nor youth nor age,But, as it were, an after-dinner's sleep,Dreaming on both; for all thy blessed youthBecomes as aged, and doth beg the almsOf palsied eld; and when thou art old and rich,Thou hast neither heat, affection, limb, nor beauty,To make thy riches pleasant. What's yet in thisThat bears the name of life? Yet in this lifeLie hid moe thousand deaths: yet death we fear,That makes these odds all even.

CLAUDIO

I humbly thank you.To sue to live, I find I seek to die;And, seeking death, find life: let it come on.

ISABELLA

[Within]  What, ho! Peace here; grace and good company!

Provost

Who's there? come in: the wish deserves a welcome.

DUKE VINCENTIO

Dear sir, ere long I'll visit you again.

CLAUDIO

Most holy sir, I thank you.Enter ISABELLA


ISABELLA

My business is a word or two with Claudio.

Provost

And very welcome. Look, signior, here's your sister.

DUKE VINCENTIO

Provost, a word with you.

Provost

As many as you please.

DUKE VINCENTIO

Bring me to hear them speak, where I may be concealed.Exeunt DUKE VINCENTIO and Provost


CLAUDIO

Now, sister, what's the comfort?

ISABELLA

Why,As all comforts are; most good, most good indeed.Lord Angelo, having affairs to heaven,Intends you for his swift ambassador,Where you shall be an everlasting leiger:Therefore your best appointment make with speed;To-morrow you set on.

CLAUDIO

Is there no remedy?

ISABELLA

None, but such remedy as, to save a head,To cleave a heart in twain.

CLAUDIO

But is there any?

ISABELLA

Yes, brother, you may live:There is a devilish mercy in the judge,If you'll implore it, that will free your life,But fetter you till death.

CLAUDIO

Perpetual durance?

ISABELLA

Ay, just; perpetual durance, a restraint,Though all the world's vastidity you had,To a determined scope.

CLAUDIO

But in what nature?

ISABELLA

In such a one as, you consenting to't,Would bark your honour from that trunk you bear,And leave you naked.

CLAUDIO

Let me know the point.

ISABELLA

O, I do fear thee, Claudio; and I quake,Lest thou a feverous life shouldst entertain,And six or seven winters more respectThan a perpetual honour. Darest thou die?The sense of death is most in apprehension;And the poor beetle, that we tread upon,In corporal sufferance finds a pang as greatAs when a giant dies.

CLAUDIO

Why give you me this shame?Think you I can a resolution fetchFrom flowery tenderness? If I must die,I will encounter darkness as a bride,And hug it in mine arms.

ISABELLA

There spake my brother; there my father's graveDid utter forth a voice. Yes, thou must die:Thou art too noble to conserve a lifeIn base appliances. This outward-sainted deputy,Whose settled visage and deliberate wordNips youth i' the head and follies doth emmewAs falcon doth the fowl, is yet a devilHis filth within being cast, he would appearA pond as deep as hell.

CLAUDIO

The prenzie Angelo!

ISABELLA

O, 'tis the cunning livery of hell,The damned'st body to invest and coverIn prenzie guards! Dost thou think, Claudio?If I would yield him my virginity,Thou mightst be freed.

CLAUDIO

O heavens! it cannot be.

ISABELLA

Yes, he would give't thee, from this rank offence,So to offend him still. This night's the timeThat I should do what I abhor to name,Or else thou diest to-morrow.

CLAUDIO

Thou shalt not do't.

ISABELLA

O, were it but my life,I'ld throw it down for your deliveranceAs frankly as a pin.

CLAUDIO

Thanks, dear Isabel.

ISABELLA

Be ready, Claudio, for your death tomorrow.

CLAUDIO

Yes. Has he affections in him,That thus can make him bite the law by the nose,When he would force it? Sure, it is no sin,Or of the deadly seven, it is the least.

ISABELLA

Which is the least?

CLAUDIO

If it were damnable, he being so wise,Why would he for the momentary trickBe perdurably fined? O Isabel!

ISABELLA

What says my brother?

CLAUDIO

Death is a fearful thing.

ISABELLA

And shamed life a hateful.

CLAUDIO

Ay, but to die, and go we know not where;To lie in cold obstruction and to rot;This sensible warm motion to becomeA kneaded clod; and the delighted spiritTo bathe in fiery floods, or to resideIn thrilling region of thick-ribbed ice;To be imprison'd in the viewless winds,And blown with restless violence round aboutThe pendent world; or to be worse than worstOf those that lawless and incertain thoughtImagine howling: 'tis too horrible!The weariest and most loathed worldly lifeThat age, ache, penury and imprisonmentCan lay on nature is a paradiseTo what we fear of death.

ISABELLA

Alas, alas!

CLAUDIO

          Sweet sister, let me live:What sin you do to save a brother's life,Nature dispenses with the deed so farThat it becomes a virtue.

ISABELLA

O you beast!O faithless coward! O dishonest wretch!Wilt thou be made a man out of my vice?Is't not a kind of incest, to take lifeFrom thine own sister's shame? What should I think?Heaven shield my mother play'd my father fair!For such a warped slip of wildernessNe'er issued from his blood. Take my defiance!Die, perish! Might but my bending downReprieve thee from thy fate, it should proceed:I'll pray a thousand prayers for thy death,No word to save thee.

CLAUDIO

Nay, hear me, Isabel.

ISABELLA

O, fie, fie, fie!Thy sin's not accidental, but a trade.Mercy to thee would prove itself a bawd:'Tis best thou diest quickly.

CLAUDIO

O hear me, Isabella!Re-enter DUKE VINCENTIO


DUKE VINCENTIO

Vouchsafe a word, young sister, but one word.

ISABELLA

What is your will?

DUKE VINCENTIO

Might you dispense with your leisure, I would by andby have some speech with you: the satisfaction Iwould require is likewise your own benefit.

ISABELLA

I have no superfluous leisure; my stay must bestolen out of other affairs; but I will attend you awhile.Walks apart


DUKE VINCENTIO

Son, I have overheard what hath passed between youand your sister. Angelo had never the purpose tocorrupt her; only he hath made an essay of hervirtue to practise his judgment with the dispositionof natures: she, having the truth of honour in her,hath made him that gracious denial which he is mostglad to receive. I am confessor to Angelo, and Iknow this to be true; therefore prepare yourself todeath: do not satisfy your resolution with hopesthat are fallible: tomorrow you must die; go toyour knees and make ready.

CLAUDIO

Let me ask my sister pardon. I am so out of lovewith life that I will sue to be rid of it.

DUKE VINCENTIO

Hold you there: farewell.Exit CLAUDIO
Provost, a word with you!Re-enter Provost


Provost

What's your will, father

DUKE VINCENTIO

That now you are come, you will be gone. Leave meawhile with the maid: my mind promises with myhabit no loss shall touch her by my company.

Provost

In good time.Exit Provost. ISABELLA comes forward


DUKE VINCENTIO

The hand that hath made you fair hath made you good:the goodness that is cheap in beauty makes beautybrief in goodness; but grace, being the soul ofyour complexion, shall keep the body of it everfair. The assault that Angelo hath made to you,fortune hath conveyed to my understanding; and, butthat frailty hath examples for his falling, I shouldwonder at Angelo. How will you do to content thissubstitute, and to save your brother?

ISABELLA

I am now going to resolve him: I had rather mybrother die by the law than my son should beunlawfully born. But, O, how much is the good dukedeceived in Angelo! If ever he return and I canspeak to him, I will open my lips in vain, ordiscover his government.

DUKE VINCENTIO

That shall not be much amiss: Yet, as the matternow stands, he will avoid your accusation; he madetrial of you only. Therefore fasten your ear on myadvisings: to the love I have in doing good aremedy presents itself. I do make myself believethat you may most uprighteously do a poor wrongedlady a merited benefit; redeem your brother fromthe angry law; do no stain to your own graciousperson; and much please the absent duke, ifperadventure he shall ever return to have hearing ofthis business.

ISABELLA

Let me hear you speak farther. I have spirit to doanything that appears not foul in the truth of my spirit.

DUKE VINCENTIO

Virtue is bold, and goodness never fearful. Haveyou not heard speak of Mariana, the sister ofFrederick the great soldier who miscarried at sea?

ISABELLA

I have heard of the lady, and good words went with her name.

DUKE VINCENTIO

She should this Angelo have married; was affiancedto her by oath, and the nuptial appointed: betweenwhich time of the contract and limit of thesolemnity, her brother Frederick was wrecked at sea,having in that perished vessel the dowry of hissister. But mark how heavily this befell to thepoor gentlewoman: there she lost a noble andrenowned brother, in his love toward her ever mostkind and natural; with him, the portion and sinew ofher fortune, her marriage-dowry; with both, hercombinate husband, this well-seeming Angelo.

ISABELLA

Can this be so? did Angelo so leave her?

DUKE VINCENTIO

Left her in her tears, and dried not one of themwith his comfort; swallowed his vows whole,pretending in her discoveries of dishonour: in few,bestowed her on her own lamentation, which she yetwears for his sake; and he, a marble to her tears,is washed with them, but relents not.

ISABELLA

What a merit were it in death to take this poor maidfrom the world! What corruption in this life, thatit will let this man live! But how out of this can she avail?

DUKE VINCENTIO

It is a rupture that you may easily heal: and thecure of it not only saves your brother, but keepsyou from dishonour in doing it.

ISABELLA

Show me how, good father.

DUKE VINCENTIO

This forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuanceof her first affection: his unjust unkindness, thatin all reason should have quenched her love, hath,like an impediment in the current, made it moreviolent and unruly. Go you to Angelo; answer hisrequiring with a plausible obedience; agree withhis demands to the point; only refer yourself tothis advantage, first, that your stay with him maynot be long; that the time may have all shadow andsilence in it; and the place answer to convenience.This being granted in course,--and now followsall,--we shall advise this wronged maid to stead upyour appointment, go in your place; if the encounteracknowledge itself hereafter, it may compel him toher recompense: and here, by this, is your brothersaved, your honour untainted, the poor Marianaadvantaged, and the corrupt deputy scaled. The maidwill I frame and make fit for his attempt. If youthink well to carry this as you may, the doublenessof the benefit defends the deceit from reproof.What think you of it?

ISABELLA

The image of it gives me content already; and Itrust it will grow to a most prosperous perfection.

DUKE VINCENTIO

It lies much in your holding up. Haste you speedilyto Angelo: if for this night he entreat you to hisbed, give him promise of satisfaction. I willpresently to Saint Luke's: there, at the moatedgrange, resides this dejected Mariana. At thatplace call upon me; and dispatch with Angelo, thatit may be quickly.

ISABELLA

I thank you for this comfort. Fare you well, good father.Exeunt severally

SCENE II. The street before the prison.

Enter, on one side, DUKE VINCENTIO disguised as before; on the other, ELBOW, and Officers with POMPEY


ELBOW

Nay, if there be no remedy for it, but that you willneeds buy and sell men and women like beasts, weshall have all the world drink brown and white bastard.

DUKE VINCENTIO

O heavens! what stuff is here

POMPEY

'Twas never merry world since, of two usuries, themerriest was put down, and the worser allowed byorder of law a furred gown to keep him warm; andfurred with fox and lamb-skins too, to signify, thatcraft, being richer than innocency, stands for the facing.

ELBOW

Come your way, sir. 'Bless you, good father friar.

DUKE VINCENTIO

And you, good brother father. What offence haththis man made you, sir?

ELBOW

Marry, sir, he hath offended the law: and, sir, wetake him to be a thief too, sir; for we have foundupon him, sir, a strange picklock, which we havesent to the deputy.

DUKE VINCENTIO

Fie, sirrah! a bawd, a wicked bawd!The evil that thou causest to be done,That is thy means to live. Do thou but thinkWhat 'tis to cram a maw or clothe a backFrom such a filthy vice: say to thyself,From their abominable and beastly touchesI drink, I eat, array myself, and live.Canst thou believe thy living is a life,So stinkingly depending? Go mend, go mend.

POMPEY

Indeed, it does stink in some sort, sir; but yet,sir, I would prove--

DUKE VINCENTIO

Nay, if the devil have given thee proofs for sin,Thou wilt prove his. Take him to prison, officer:Correction and instruction must both workEre this rude beast will profit.

ELBOW

He must before the deputy, sir; he has given himwarning: the deputy cannot abide a whoremaster: ifhe be a whoremonger, and comes before him, he wereas good go a mile on his errand.

DUKE VINCENTIO

That we were all, as some would seem to be,From our faults, as faults from seeming, free!

ELBOW

His neck will come to your waist,--a cord, sir.

POMPEY

I spy comfort; I cry bail. Here's a gentleman and afriend of mine.Enter LUCIO


LUCIO

How now, noble Pompey! What, at the wheels ofCaesar? art thou led in triumph? What, is therenone of Pygmalion's images, newly made woman, to behad now, for putting the hand in the pocket andextracting it clutch'd? What reply, ha? Whatsayest thou to this tune, matter and method? Is'tnot drowned i' the last rain, ha? What sayestthou, Trot? Is the world as it was, man? Which isthe way? Is it sad, and few words? or how? Thetrick of it?

DUKE VINCENTIO

Still thus, and thus; still worse!

LUCIO

How doth my dear morsel, thy mistress? Procures shestill, ha?

POMPEY

Troth, sir, she hath eaten up all her beef, and sheis herself in the tub.

LUCIO

Why, 'tis good; it is the right of it; it must beso: ever your fresh whore and your powdered bawd:an unshunned consequence; it must be so. Art goingto prison, Pompey?

POMPEY

Yes, faith, sir.

LUCIO

Why, 'tis not amiss, Pompey. Farewell: go, say Isent thee thither. For debt, Pompey? or how?

ELBOW

For being a bawd, for being a bawd.

LUCIO

Well, then, imprison him: if imprisonment be thedue of a bawd, why, 'tis his right: bawd is hedoubtless, and of antiquity too; bawd-born.Farewell, good Pompey. Commend me to the prison,Pompey: you will turn good husband now, Pompey; youwill keep the house.

POMPEY

I hope, sir, your good worship will be my bail.

LUCIO

No, indeed, will I not, Pompey; it is not the wear.I will pray, Pompey, to increase your bondage: Ifyou take it not patiently, why, your mettle is themore. Adieu, trusty Pompey. 'Bless you, friar.

DUKE VINCENTIO

And you.

LUCIO

Does Bridget paint still, Pompey, ha?

ELBOW

Come your ways, sir; come.

POMPEY

You will not bail me, then, sir?

LUCIO

Then, Pompey, nor now. What news abroad, friar?what news?

ELBOW

Come your ways, sir; come.

LUCIO

Go to kennel, Pompey; go.Exeunt ELBOW, POMPEY and Officers
What news, friar, of the duke?

DUKE VINCENTIO

I know none. Can you tell me of any?

LUCIO

Some say he is with the Emperor of Russia; othersome, he is in Rome: but where is he, think you?

DUKE VINCENTIO

I know not where; but wheresoever, I wish him well.

LUCIO

It was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal fromthe state, and usurp the beggary he was never bornto. Lord Angelo dukes it well in his absence; heputs transgression to 't.

DUKE VINCENTIO

He does well in 't.

LUCIO

A little more lenity to lechery would do no harm inhim: something too crabbed that way, friar.

DUKE VINCENTIO

It is too general a vice, and severity must cure it.

LUCIO

Yes, in good sooth, the vice is of a great kindred;it is well allied: but it is impossible to extirpit quite, friar, till eating and drinking be putdown. They say this Angelo was not made by man andwoman after this downright way of creation: is ittrue, think you?

DUKE VINCENTIO

How should he be made, then?

LUCIO

Some report a sea-maid spawned him; some, that hewas begot between two stock-fishes. But it iscertain that when he makes water his urine iscongealed ice; that I know to be true: and he is amotion generative; that's infallible.

DUKE VINCENTIO

You are pleasant, sir, and speak apace.

LUCIO

Why, what a ruthless thing is this in him, for therebellion of a codpiece to take away the life of aman! Would the duke that is absent have done this?Ere he would have hanged a man for the getting ahundred bastards, he would have paid for the nursinga thousand: he had some feeling of the sport: heknew the service, and that instructed him to mercy.

DUKE VINCENTIO

I never heard the absent duke much detected forwomen; he was not inclined that way.

LUCIO

O, sir, you are deceived.

DUKE VINCENTIO

'Tis not possible.

LUCIO

Who, not the duke? yes, your beggar of fifty; andhis use was to put a ducat in her clack-dish: theduke had crotchets in him. He would be drunk too;that let me inform you.

DUKE VINCENTIO

You do him wrong, surely.

LUCIO

Sir, I was an inward of his. A shy fellow was theduke: and I believe I know the cause of hiswithdrawing.

DUKE VINCENTIO

What, I prithee, might be the cause?

LUCIO

No, pardon; 'tis a secret must be locked within theteeth and the lips: but this I can let youunderstand, the greater file of the subject held theduke to be wise.

DUKE VINCENTIO

Wise! why, no question but he was.

LUCIO

A very superficial, ignorant, unweighing fellow.

DUKE VINCENTIO

Either this is the envy in you, folly, or mistaking:the very stream of his life and the business he hathhelmed must upon a warranted need give him a betterproclamation. Let him be but testimonied in his ownbringings-forth, and he shall appear to theenvious a scholar, a statesman and a soldier.Therefore you speak unskilfully: or if yourknowledge be more it is much darkened in your malice.

LUCIO

Sir, I know him, and I love him.

DUKE VINCENTIO

Love talks with better knowledge, and knowledge withdearer love.

LUCIO

Come, sir, I know what I know.

DUKE VINCENTIO

I can hardly believe that, since you know not whatyou speak. But, if ever the duke return, as ourprayers are he may, let me desire you to make youranswer before him. If it be honest you have spoke,you have courage to maintain it: I am bound to callupon you; and, I pray you, your name?

LUCIO

Sir, my name is Lucio; well known to the duke.

DUKE VINCENTIO

He shall know you better, sir, if I may live toreport you.

LUCIO

I fear you not.

DUKE VINCENTIO

O, you hope the duke will return no more; or youimagine me too unhurtful an opposite. But indeed Ican do you little harm; you'll forswear this again.

LUCIO

I'll be hanged first: thou art deceived in me,friar. But no more of this. Canst thou tell ifClaudio die to-morrow or no?

DUKE VINCENTIO

Why should he die, sir?

LUCIO

Why? For filling a bottle with a tundish. I wouldthe duke we talk of were returned again: theungenitured agent will unpeople the province withcontinency; sparrows must not build in hishouse-eaves, because they are lecherous. The dukeyet would have dark deeds darkly answered; he wouldnever bring them to light: would he were returned!Marry, this Claudio is condemned for untrussing.Farewell, good friar: I prithee, pray for me. Theduke, I say to thee again, would eat mutton onFridays. He's not past it yet, and I say to thee,he would mouth with a beggar, though she smelt brownbread and garlic: say that I said so. Farewell.Exit


DUKE VINCENTIO

No might nor greatness in mortalityCan censure 'scape; back-wounding calumnyThe whitest virtue strikes. What king so strongCan tie the gall up in the slanderous tongue?But who comes here?Enter ESCALUS, Provost, and Officers with MISTRESS OVERDONE


ESCALUS

Go; away with her to prison!

MISTRESS OVERDONE

Good my lord, be good to me; your honour is accounteda merciful man; good my lord.

ESCALUS

Double and treble admonition, and still forfeit inthe same kind! This would make mercy swear and playthe tyrant.

Provost

A bawd of eleven years' continuance, may it pleaseyour honour.

MISTRESS OVERDONE

My lord, this is one Lucio's information against me.Mistress Kate Keepdown was with child by him in theduke's time; he promised her marriage: his childis a year and a quarter old, come Philip and Jacob:I have kept it myself; and see how he goes about to abuse me!

ESCALUS

That fellow is a fellow of much licence: let him becalled before us. Away with her to prison! Go to;no more words.Exeunt Officers with MISTRESS OVERDONE
Provost, my brother Angelo will not be altered;Claudio must die to-morrow: let him be furnishedwith divines, and have all charitable preparation.if my brother wrought by my pity, it should not beso with him.

Provost

So please you, this friar hath been with him, andadvised him for the entertainment of death.

ESCALUS

Good even, good father.

DUKE VINCENTIO

Bliss and goodness on you!

ESCALUS

Of whence are you?

DUKE VINCENTIO

Not of this country, though my chance is nowTo use it for my time: I am a brotherOf gracious order, late come from the SeeIn special business from his holiness.

ESCALUS

What news abroad i' the world?

DUKE VINCENTIO

None, but that there is so great a fever ongoodness, that the dissolution of it must cure it:novelty is only in request; and it is as dangerousto be aged in any kind of course, as it is virtuousto be constant in any undertaking. There is scarcetruth enough alive to make societies secure; butsecurity enough to make fellowships accurst: muchupon this riddle runs the wisdom of the world. Thisnews is old enough, yet it is every day's news. Ipray you, sir, of what disposition was the duke?

ESCALUS

One that, above all other strifes, contendedespecially to know himself.

DUKE VINCENTIO

What pleasure was he given to?

ESCALUS

Rather rejoicing to see another merry, than merry atany thing which professed to make him rejoice: agentleman of all temperance. But leave we him tohis events, with a prayer they may prove prosperous;and let me desire to know how you find Claudioprepared. I am made to understand that you havelent him visitation.

DUKE VINCENTIO

He professes to have received no sinister measurefrom his judge, but most willingly humbles himselfto the determination of justice: yet had he framedto himself, by the instruction of his frailty, manydeceiving promises of life; which I by my goodleisure have discredited to him, and now is heresolved to die.

ESCALUS

You have paid the heavens your function, and theprisoner the very debt of your calling. I havelaboured for the poor gentleman to the extremestshore of my modesty: but my brother justice have Ifound so severe, that he hath forced me to tell himhe is indeed Justice.

DUKE VINCENTIO

If his own life answer the straitness of hisproceeding, it shall become him well; wherein if hechance to fail, he hath sentenced himself.

ESCALUS

I am going to visit the prisoner. Fare you well.

DUKE VINCENTIO

Peace be with you!Exeunt ESCALUS and Provost
He who the sword of heaven will bearShould be as holy as severe;Pattern in himself to know,Grace to stand, and virtue go;More nor less to others payingThan by self-offences weighing.Shame to him whose cruel strikingKills for faults of his own liking!Twice treble shame on Angelo,To weed my vice and let his grow!O, what may man within him hide,Though angel on the outward side!How may likeness made in crimes,Making practise on the times,To draw with idle spiders' stringsMost ponderous and substantial things!Craft against vice I must apply:With Angelo to-night shall lieHis old betrothed but despised;So disguise shall, by the disguised,Pay with falsehood false exacting,And perform an old contracting.Exit

ACT IV
SCENE I. The moated grange at ST. LUKE's.

Enter MARIANA and a Boy


Boy sings


Take, O, take those lips away,That so sweetly were forsworn;And those eyes, the break of day,Lights that do mislead the morn:But my kisses bring again, bring again;Seals of love, but sealed in vain, sealed in vain.

MARIANA

Break off thy song, and haste thee quick away:Here comes a man of comfort, whose adviceHath often still'd my brawling discontent.Exit Boy
Enter DUKE VINCENTIO disguised as before
I cry you mercy, sir; and well could wishYou had not found me here so musical:Let me excuse me, and believe me so,My mirth it much displeased, but pleased my woe.

DUKE VINCENTIO

'Tis good; though music oft hath such a charmTo make bad good, and good provoke to harm.I pray, you, tell me, hath any body inquiredfor me here to-day? much upon this time haveI promised here to meet.

MARIANA

You have not been inquired after:I have sat here all day.Enter ISABELLA


DUKE VINCENTIO

I do constantly believe you. The time is come evennow. I shall crave your forbearance a little: maybe I will call upon you anon, for some advantage to yourself.

MARIANA

I am always bound to you.Exit


DUKE VINCENTIO

Very well met, and well come.What is the news from this good deputy?

ISABELLA

He hath a garden circummured with brick,Whose western side is with a vineyard back'd;And to that vineyard is a planched gate,That makes his opening with this bigger key:This other doth command a little doorWhich from the vineyard to the garden leads;There have I made my promiseUpon the heavy middle of the nightTo call upon him.

DUKE VINCENTIO

But shall you on your knowledge find this way?

ISABELLA

I have ta'en a due and wary note upon't:With whispering and most guilty diligence,In action all of precept, he did show meThe way twice o'er.

DUKE VINCENTIO

Are there no other tokensBetween you 'greed concerning her observance?

ISABELLA

No, none, but only a repair i' the dark;And that I have possess'd him my most stayCan be but brief; for I have made him knowI have a servant comes with me along,That stays upon me, whose persuasion isI come about my brother.

DUKE VINCENTIO

'Tis well borne up.I have not yet made known to MarianaA word of this. What, ho! within! come forth!Re-enter MARIANA
I pray you, be acquainted with this maid;She comes to do you good.

ISABELLA

I do desire the like.

DUKE VINCENTIO

Do you persuade yourself that I respect you?

MARIANA

Good friar, I know you do, and have found it.

DUKE VINCENTIO

Take, then, this your companion by the hand,Who hath a story ready for your ear.I shall attend your leisure: but make haste;The vaporous night approaches.

MARIANA

Will't please you walk aside?Exeunt MARIANA and ISABELLA


DUKE VINCENTIO

O place and greatness! millions of false eyesAre stuck upon thee: volumes of reportRun with these false and most contrarious questsUpon thy doings: thousand escapes of witMake thee the father of their idle dreamsAnd rack thee in their fancies.Re-enter MARIANA and ISABELLA
Welcome, how agreed?

ISABELLA

She'll take the enterprise upon her, father,If you advise it.

DUKE VINCENTIO

                  It is not my consent,But my entreaty too.

ISABELLA

Little have you to sayWhen you depart from him, but, soft and low,'Remember now my brother.'

MARIANA

Fear me not.

DUKE VINCENTIO

Nor, gentle daughter, fear you not at all.He is your husband on a pre-contract:To bring you thus together, 'tis no sin,Sith that the justice of your title to himDoth flourish the deceit. Come, let us go:Our corn's to reap, for yet our tithe's to sow.Exeunt

SCENE II. A room in the prison.

Enter Provost and POMPEY


Provost

Come hither, sirrah. Can you cut off a man's head?

POMPEY

If the man be a bachelor, sir, I can; but if he be amarried man, he's his wife's head, and I can nevercut off a woman's head.

Provost

Come, sir, leave me your snatches, and yield me adirect answer. To-morrow morning are to die Claudioand Barnardine. Here is in our prison a commonexecutioner, who in his office lacks a helper: ifyou will take it on you to assist him, it shallredeem you from your gyves; if not, you shall haveyour full time of imprisonment and your deliverancewith an unpitied whipping, for you have been anotorious bawd.

POMPEY

Sir, I have been an unlawful bawd time out of mind;but yet I will be content to be a lawful hangman. Iwould be glad to receive some instruction from myfellow partner.

Provost

What, ho! Abhorson! Where's Abhorson, there?Enter ABHORSON


ABHORSON

Do you call, sir?

Provost

Sirrah, here's a fellow will help you to-morrow inyour execution. If you think it meet, compound withhim by the year, and let him abide here with you; ifnot, use him for the present and dismiss him. Hecannot plead his estimation with you; he hath been a bawd.

ABHORSON

A bawd, sir? fie upon him! he will discredit our mystery.

Provost

Go to, sir; you weigh equally; a feather will turnthe scale.Exit


POMPEY

Pray, sir, by your good favour,--for surely, sir, agood favour you have, but that you have a hanginglook,--do you call, sir, your occupation a mystery?

ABHORSON

Ay, sir; a mystery

POMPEY

Painting, sir, I have heard say, is a mystery; andyour whores, sir, being members of my occupation,using painting, do prove my occupation a mystery:but what mystery there should be in hanging, if Ishould be hanged, I cannot imagine.

ABHORSON

Sir, it is a mystery.

POMPEY

Proof?

ABHORSON

Every true man's apparel fits your thief: if it betoo little for your thief, your true man thinks itbig enough; if it be too big for your thief, yourthief thinks it little enough: so every true man'sapparel fits your thief.Re-enter Provost


Provost

Are you agreed?

POMPEY

Sir, I will serve him; for I do find your hangman isa more penitent trade than your bawd; he dothoftener ask forgiveness.

Provost

You, sirrah, provide your block and your axeto-morrow four o'clock.

ABHORSON

Come on, bawd; I will instruct thee in my trade; follow.

POMPEY

I do desire to learn, sir: and I hope, if you haveoccasion to use me for your own turn, you shall findme yare; for truly, sir, for your kindness I owe youa good turn.

Provost

Call hither Barnardine and Claudio:Exeunt POMPEY and ABHORSON
The one has my pity; not a jot the other,Being a murderer, though he were my brother.Enter CLAUDIO
Look, here's the warrant, Claudio, for thy death:'Tis now dead midnight, and by eight to-morrowThou must be made immortal. Where's Barnardine?

CLAUDIO

As fast lock'd up in sleep as guiltless labourWhen it lies starkly in the traveller's bones:He will not wake.

Provost

                  Who can do good on him?Well, go, prepare yourself.Knocking within
But, hark, what noise?Heaven give your spirits comfort!Exit CLAUDIO
By and by.I hope it is some pardon or reprieveFor the most gentle Claudio.Enter DUKE VINCENTIO disguised as before
Welcome father.

DUKE VINCENTIO

The best and wholesomest spirts of the nightEnvelope you, good Provost! Who call'd here of late?

Provost

None, since the curfew rung.

DUKE VINCENTIO

Not Isabel?

Provost

          No.

DUKE VINCENTIO

                  They will, then, ere't be long.

Provost

What comfort is for Claudio?

DUKE VINCENTIO

There's some in hope.

Provost

It is a bitter deputy.

DUKE VINCENTIO

Not so, not so; his life is parallel'dEven with the stroke and line of his great justice:He doth with holy abstinence subdueThat in himself which he spurs on his powerTo qualify in others: were he meal'd with thatWhich he corrects, then were he tyrannous;But this being so, he's just.Knocking within
Now are they come.Exit Provost
This is a gentle provost: seldom whenThe steeled gaoler is the friend of men.Knocking within
How now! what noise? That spirit's possessed with hasteThat wounds the unsisting postern with these strokes.Re-enter Provost


Provost

There he must stay until the officerArise to let him in: he is call'd up.

DUKE VINCENTIO

Have you no countermand for Claudio yet,But he must die to-morrow?

Provost

None, sir, none.

DUKE VINCENTIO

As near the dawning, provost, as it is,You shall hear more ere morning.

Provost

HappilyYou something know; yet I believe there comesNo countermand; no such example have we:Besides, upon the very siege of justiceLord Angelo hath to the public earProfess'd the contrary.Enter a Messenger
This is his lordship's man.

DUKE VINCENTIO

And here comes Claudio's pardon.

Messenger

[Giving a paper]My lord hath sent you this note; and by me thisfurther charge, that you swerve not from thesmallest article of it, neither in time, matter, orother circumstance. Good morrow; for, as I take it,it is almost day.

Provost

I shall obey him.Exit Messenger


DUKE VINCENTIO

[Aside]  This is his pardon, purchased by such sinFor which the pardoner himself is in.Hence hath offence his quick celerity,When it is born in high authority:When vice makes mercy, mercy's so extended,That for the fault's love is the offender friended.Now, sir, what news?

Provost

I told you. Lord Angelo, belike thinking me remissin mine office, awakens me with this unwontedputting-on; methinks strangely, for he hath not used it before.

DUKE VINCENTIO

Pray you, let's hear.

Provost

[Reads]'Whatsoever you may hear to the contrary, letClaudio be executed by four of the clock; and in theafternoon Barnardine: for my better satisfaction,let me have Claudio's head sent me by five. Letthis be duly performed; with a thought that moredepends on it than we must yet deliver. Thus failnot to do your office, as you will answer it at your peril.'What say you to this, sir?

DUKE VINCENTIO

What is that Barnardine who is to be executed in theafternoon?

Provost

A Bohemian born, but here nursed un and bred; onethat is a prisoner nine years old.

DUKE VINCENTIO

How came it that the absent duke had not eitherdelivered him to his liberty or executed him? Ihave heard it was ever his manner to do so.

Provost

His friends still wrought reprieves for him: and,indeed, his fact, till now in the government of LordAngelo, came not to an undoubtful proof.

DUKE VINCENTIO

It is now apparent?

Provost

Most manifest, and not denied by himself.

DUKE VINCENTIO

Hath he born himself penitently in prison? howseems he to be touched?

Provost

A man that apprehends death no more dreadfully butas a drunken sleep; careless, reckless, and fearlessof what's past, present, or to come; insensible ofmortality, and desperately mortal.

DUKE VINCENTIO

He wants advice.

Provost

He will hear none: he hath evermore had the libertyof the prison; give him leave to escape hence, hewould not: drunk many times a day, if not many daysentirely drunk. We have very oft awaked him, as ifto carry him to execution, and showed him a seemingwarrant for it: it hath not moved him at all.

DUKE VINCENTIO

More of him anon. There is written in your brow,provost, honesty and constancy: if I read it nottruly, my ancient skill beguiles me; but, in theboldness of my cunning, I will lay myself in hazard.Claudio, whom here you have warrant to execute, isno greater forfeit to the law than Angelo who hathsentenced him. To make you understand this in amanifested effect, I crave but four days' respite;for the which you are to do me both a present and adangerous courtesy.

Provost

Pray, sir, in what?

DUKE VINCENTIO

In the delaying death.

Provost

A lack, how may I do it, having the hour limited,and an express command, under penalty, to deliverhis head in the view of Angelo? I may make my caseas Claudio's, to cross this in the smallest.

DUKE VINCENTIO

By the vow of mine order I warrant you, if myinstructions may be your guide. Let this Barnardinebe this morning executed, and his head born to Angelo.

Provost

Angelo hath seen them both, and will discover the favour.

DUKE VINCENTIO

O, death's a great disguiser; and you may add to it.Shave the head, and tie the beard; and say it wasthe desire of the penitent to be so bared before hisdeath: you know the course is common. If any thingfall to you upon this, more than thanks and goodfortune, by the saint whom I profess, I will pleadagainst it with my life.

Provost

Pardon me, good father; it is against my oath.

DUKE VINCENTIO

Were you sworn to the duke, or to the deputy?

Provost

To him, and to his substitutes.

DUKE VINCENTIO

You will think you have made no offence, if the dukeavouch the justice of your dealing?

Provost

But what likelihood is in that?

DUKE VINCENTIO

Not a resemblance, but a certainty. Yet since I seeyou fearful, that neither my coat, integrity, norpersuasion can with ease attempt you, I will gofurther than I meant, to pluck all fears out of you.Look you, sir, here is the hand and seal of theduke: you know the character, I doubt not; and thesignet is not strange to you.

Provost

I know them both.

DUKE VINCENTIO

The contents of this is the return of the duke: youshall anon over-read it at your pleasure; where youshall find, within these two days he will be here.This is a thing that Angelo knows not; for he thisvery day receives letters of strange tenor;perchance of the duke's death; perchance enteringinto some monastery; but, by chance, nothing of whatis writ. Look, the unfolding star calls up theshepherd. Put not yourself into amazement how thesethings should be: all difficulties are but easywhen they are known. Call your executioner, and offwith Barnardine's head: I will give him a presentshrift and advise him for a better place. Yet youare amazed; but this shall absolutely resolve you.Come away; it is almost clear dawn.Exeunt

SCENE III. Another room in the same.

Enter POMPEY


POMPEY

I am as well acquainted here as I was in our houseof profession: one would think it were MistressOverdone's own house, for here be many of her oldcustomers. First, here's young Master Rash; he's infor a commodity of brown paper and old ginger,ninescore and seventeen pounds; of which he madefive marks, ready money: marry, then ginger was notmuch in request, for the old women were all dead.Then is there here one Master Caper, at the suit ofMaster Three-pile the mercer, for some four suits ofpeach-coloured satin, which now peaches him abeggar. Then have we here young Dizy, and youngMaster Deep-vow, and Master Copperspur, and MasterStarve-lackey the rapier and dagger man, and youngDrop-heir that killed lusty Pudding, and MasterForthlight the tilter, and brave Master Shooty thegreat traveller, and wild Half-can that stabbedPots, and, I think, forty more; all great doers inour trade, and are now 'for the Lord's sake.'Enter ABHORSON


ABHORSON

Sirrah, bring Barnardine hither.

POMPEY

Master Barnardine! you must rise and be hanged.Master Barnardine!

ABHORSON

What, ho, Barnardine!

BARNARDINE

[Within]  A pox o' your throats! Who makes thatnoise there? What are you?

POMPEY

Your friends, sir; the hangman. You must be sogood, sir, to rise and be put to death.

BARNARDINE

[Within]  Away, you rogue, away! I am sleepy.

ABHORSON

Tell him he must awake, and that quickly too.

POMPEY

Pray, Master Barnardine, awake till you areexecuted, and sleep afterwards.

ABHORSON

Go in to him, and fetch him out.

POMPEY

He is coming, sir, he is coming; I hear his straw rustle.

ABHORSON

Is the axe upon the block, sirrah?

POMPEY

Very ready, sir.Enter BARNARDINE


BARNARDINE

How now, Abhorson? what's the news with you?

ABHORSON

Truly, sir, I would desire you to clap into yourprayers; for, look you, the warrant's come.

BARNARDINE

You rogue, I have been drinking all night; I am notfitted for 't.

POMPEY

O, the better, sir; for he that drinks all night,and is hanged betimes in the morning, may sleep thesounder all the next day.

ABHORSON

Look you, sir; here comes your ghostly father: dowe jest now, think you?Enter DUKE VINCENTIO disguised as before


DUKE VINCENTIO

Sir, induced by my charity, and hearing how hastilyyou are to depart, I am come to advise you, comfortyou and pray with you.

BARNARDINE

Friar, not I	I have been drinking hard all night,and I will have more time to prepare me, or theyshall beat out my brains with billets: I will notconsent to die this day, that's certain.

DUKE VINCENTIO

O, sir, you must: and therefore I beseech youLook forward on the journey you shall go.

BARNARDINE

I swear I will not die to-day for any man'spersuasion.

DUKE VINCENTIO

But hear you.

BARNARDINE

Not a word: if you have any thing to say to me,come to my ward; for thence will not I to-day.Exit


DUKE VINCENTIO

Unfit to live or die: O gravel heart!After him, fellows; bring him to the block.Exeunt ABHORSON and POMPEY
Re-enter Provost


Provost

Now, sir, how do you find the prisoner?

DUKE VINCENTIO

A creature unprepared, unmeet for death;And to transport him in the mind he isWere damnable.

Provost

                  Here in the prison, father,There died this morning of a cruel feverOne Ragozine, a most notorious pirate,A man of Claudio's years; his beard and headJust of his colour. What if we do omitThis reprobate till he were well inclined;And satisfy the deputy with the visageOf Ragozine, more like to Claudio?

DUKE VINCENTIO

O, 'tis an accident that heaven provides!Dispatch it presently; the hour draws onPrefix'd by Angelo: see this be done,And sent according to command; whiles IPersuade this rude wretch willingly to die.

Provost

This shall be done, good father, presently.But Barnardine must die this afternoon:And how shall we continue Claudio,To save me from the danger that might comeIf he were known alive?

DUKE VINCENTIO

Let this be done.Put them in secret holds, both Barnardine and Claudio:Ere twice the sun hath made his journal greetingTo the under generation, you shall findYour safety manifested.

Provost

I am your free dependant.

DUKE VINCENTIO

Quick, dispatch, and send the head to Angelo.Exit Provost
Now will I write letters to Angelo,--The provost, he shall bear them, whose contentsShall witness to him I am near at home,And that, by great injunctions, I am boundTo enter publicly: him I'll desireTo meet me at the consecrated fountA league below the city; and from thence,By cold gradation and well-balanced form,We shall proceed with Angelo.Re-enter Provost


Provost

Here is the head; I'll carry it myself.

DUKE VINCENTIO

Convenient is it. Make a swift return;For I would commune with you of such thingsThat want no ear but yours.

Provost

I'll make all speed.Exit


ISABELLA

[Within]  Peace, ho, be here!

DUKE VINCENTIO

The tongue of Isabel. She's come to knowIf yet her brother's pardon be come hither:But I will keep her ignorant of her good,To make her heavenly comforts of despair,When it is least expected.Enter ISABELLA


ISABELLA

Ho, by your leave!

DUKE VINCENTIO

Good morning to you, fair and gracious daughter.

ISABELLA

The better, given me by so holy a man.Hath yet the deputy sent my brother's pardon?

DUKE VINCENTIO

He hath released him, Isabel, from the world:His head is off and sent to Angelo.

ISABELLA

Nay, but it is not so.

DUKE VINCENTIO

It is no other: show your wisdom, daughter,In your close patience.

ISABELLA

O, I will to him and pluck out his eyes!

DUKE VINCENTIO

You shall not be admitted to his sight.

ISABELLA

Unhappy Claudio! wretched Isabel!Injurious world! most damned Angelo!

DUKE VINCENTIO

This nor hurts him nor profits you a jot;Forbear it therefore; give your cause to heaven.Mark what I say, which you shall findBy every syllable a faithful verity:The duke comes home to-morrow; nay, dry your eyes;One of our convent, and his confessor,Gives me this instance: already he hath carriedNotice to Escalus and Angelo,Who do prepare to meet him at the gates,There to give up their power. If you can, pace your wisdomIn that good path that I would wish it go,And you shall have your bosom on this wretch,Grace of the duke, revenges to your heart,And general honour.

ISABELLA

                  I am directed by you.

DUKE VINCENTIO

This letter, then, to Friar Peter give;'Tis that he sent me of the duke's return:Say, by this token, I desire his companyAt Mariana's house to-night. Her cause and yoursI'll perfect him withal, and he shall bring youBefore the duke, and to the head of AngeloAccuse him home and home. For my poor self,I am combined by a sacred vowAnd shall be absent. Wend you with this letter:Command these fretting waters from your eyesWith a light heart; trust not my holy order,If I pervert your course. Who's here?Enter LUCIO


LUCIO

Good even. Friar, where's the provost?

DUKE VINCENTIO

Not within, sir.

LUCIO

O pretty Isabella, I am pale at mine heart to seethine eyes so red: thou must be patient. I am fainto dine and sup with water and bran; I dare not formy head fill my belly; one fruitful meal would setme to 't. But they say the duke will be hereto-morrow. By my troth, Isabel, I loved thy brother:if the old fantastical duke of dark corners had beenat home, he had lived.Exit ISABELLA


DUKE VINCENTIO

Sir, the duke is marvellous little beholding to yourreports; but the best is, he lives not in them.

LUCIO

Friar, thou knowest not the duke so well as I do:he's a better woodman than thou takest him for.

DUKE VINCENTIO

Well, you'll answer this one day. Fare ye well.

LUCIO

Nay, tarry; I'll go along with theeI can tell thee pretty tales of the duke.

DUKE VINCENTIO

You have told me too many of him already, sir, ifthey be true; if not true, none were enough.

LUCIO

I was once before him for getting a wench with child.

DUKE VINCENTIO

Did you such a thing?

LUCIO

Yes, marry, did I	but I was fain to forswear it;they would else have married me to the rotten medlar.

DUKE VINCENTIO

Sir, your company is fairer than honest. Rest you well.

LUCIO

By my troth, I'll go with thee to the lane's end:if bawdy talk offend you, we'll have very little ofit. Nay, friar, I am a kind of burr; I shall stick.Exeunt

SCENE IV. A room in ANGELO's house.

Enter ANGELO and ESCALUS


ESCALUS

Every letter he hath writ hath disvouched other.

ANGELO

In most uneven and distracted manner. His actionsshow much like to madness: pray heaven his wisdom benot tainted! And why meet him at the gates, andredeliver our authorities there

ESCALUS

I guess not.

ANGELO

And why should we proclaim it in an hour before hisentering, that if any crave redress of injustice,they should exhibit their petitions in the street?

ESCALUS

He shows his reason for that: to have a dispatch ofcomplaints, and to deliver us from deviceshereafter, which shall then have no power to standagainst us.

ANGELO

Well, I beseech you, let it be proclaimed betimesi' the morn; I'll call you at your house: givenotice to such men of sort and suit as are to meethim.

ESCALUS

I shall, sir. Fare you well.

ANGELO

Good night.Exit ESCALUS
This deed unshapes me quite, makes me unpregnantAnd dull to all proceedings. A deflower'd maid!And by an eminent body that enforcedThe law against it! But that her tender shameWill not proclaim against her maiden loss,How might she tongue me! Yet reason dares her no;For my authority bears of a credent bulk,That no particular scandal once can touchBut it confounds the breather. He should have lived,Save that riotous youth, with dangerous sense,Might in the times to come have ta'en revenge,By so receiving a dishonour'd lifeWith ransom of such shame. Would yet he had lived!A lack, when once our grace we have forgot,Nothing goes right: we would, and we would not.Exit

SCENE V. Fields without the town.

Enter DUKE VINCENTIO in his own habit, and FRIAR PETER


DUKE VINCENTIO

These letters at fit time deliver meGiving letters
The provost knows our purpose and our plot.The matter being afoot, keep your instruction,And hold you ever to our special drift;Though sometimes you do blench from this to that,As cause doth minister. Go call at Flavius' house,And tell him where I stay: give the like noticeTo Valentinus, Rowland, and to Crassus,And bid them bring the trumpets to the gate;But send me Flavius first.

FRIAR PETER

It shall be speeded well.Exit
Enter VARRIUS


DUKE VINCENTIO

I thank thee, Varrius; thou hast made good haste:Come, we will walk. There's other of our friendsWill greet us here anon, my gentle Varrius.Exeunt

SCENE VI. Street near the city gate.

Enter ISABELLA and MARIANA


ISABELLA

To speak so indirectly I am loath:I would say the truth; but to accuse him so,That is your part: yet I am advised to do it;He says, to veil full purpose.

MARIANA

Be ruled by him.

ISABELLA

Besides, he tells me that, if peradventureHe speak against me on the adverse side,I should not think it strange; for 'tis a physicThat's bitter to sweet end.

MARIANA

I would Friar Peter--

ISABELLA

O, peace! the friar is come.Enter FRIAR PETER


FRIAR PETER

Come, I have found you out a stand most fit,Where you may have such vantage on the duke,He shall not pass you. Twice have the trumpets sounded;The generous and gravest citizensHave hent the gates, and very near uponThe duke is entering: therefore, hence, away!Exeunt

ACT V
SCENE I. The city gate.

MARIANA veiled, ISABELLA, and FRIAR PETER, at their  stand. Enter DUKE VINCENTIO, VARRIUS, Lords,  ANGELO, ESCALUS, LUCIO, Provost, Officers, and Citizens, at several doors


DUKE VINCENTIO

My very worthy cousin, fairly met!Our old and faithful friend, we are glad to see you.

ANGELO

ESCALUS

Happy return be to your royal grace!

DUKE VINCENTIO

Many and hearty thankings to you both.We have made inquiry of you; and we hearSuch goodness of your justice, that our soulCannot but yield you forth to public thanks,Forerunning more requital.

ANGELO

You make my bonds still greater.

DUKE VINCENTIO

O, your desert speaks loud; and I should wrong it,To lock it in the wards of covert bosom,When it deserves, with characters of brass,A forted residence 'gainst the tooth of timeAnd razure of oblivion. Give me your hand,And let the subject see, to make them knowThat outward courtesies would fain proclaimFavours that keep within. Come, Escalus,You must walk by us on our other hand;And good supporters are you.FRIAR PETER and ISABELLA come forward


FRIAR PETER

Now is your time: speak loud and kneel before him.

ISABELLA

Justice, O royal duke! Vail your regardUpon a wrong'd, I would fain have said, a maid!O worthy prince, dishonour not your eyeBy throwing it on any other objectTill you have heard me in my true complaintAnd given me justice, justice, justice, justice!

DUKE VINCENTIO

Relate your wrongs; in what? by whom? be brief.Here is Lord Angelo shall give you justice:Reveal yourself to him.

ISABELLA

O worthy duke,You bid me seek redemption of the devil:Hear me yourself; for that which I must speakMust either punish me, not being believed,Or wring redress from you. Hear me, O hear me, here!

ANGELO

My lord, her wits, I fear me, are not firm:She hath been a suitor to me for her brotherCut off by course of justice,--

ISABELLA

By course of justice!

ANGELO

And she will speak most bitterly and strange.

ISABELLA

Most strange, but yet most truly, will I speak:That Angelo's forsworn; is it not strange?That Angelo's a murderer; is 't not strange?That Angelo is an adulterous thief,An hypocrite, a virgin-violator;Is it not strange and strange?

DUKE VINCENTIO

Nay, it is ten times strange.

ISABELLA

It is not truer he is AngeloThan this is all as true as it is strange:Nay, it is ten times true; for truth is truthTo the end of reckoning.

DUKE VINCENTIO

Away with her! Poor soul,She speaks this in the infirmity of sense.

ISABELLA

O prince, I conjure thee, as thou believestThere is another comfort than this world,That thou neglect me not, with that opinionThat I am touch'd with madness! Make not impossibleThat which but seems unlike: 'tis not impossibleBut one, the wicked'st caitiff on the ground,May seem as shy, as grave, as just, as absoluteAs Angelo; even so may Angelo,In all his dressings, characts, titles, forms,Be an arch-villain; believe it, royal prince:If he be less, he's nothing; but he's more,Had I more name for badness.

DUKE VINCENTIO

By mine honesty,If she be mad,--as I believe no other,--Her madness hath the oddest frame of sense,Such a dependency of thing on thing,As e'er I heard in madness.

ISABELLA

O gracious duke,Harp not on that, nor do not banish reasonFor inequality; but let your reason serveTo make the truth appear where it seems hid,And hide the false seems true.

DUKE VINCENTIO

Many that are not madHave, sure, more lack of reason. What would you say?

ISABELLA

I am the sister of one Claudio,Condemn'd upon the act of fornicationTo lose his head; condemn'd by Angelo:I, in probation of a sisterhood,Was sent to by my brother; one LucioAs then the messenger,--

LUCIO

That's I, an't like your grace:I came to her from Claudio, and desired herTo try her gracious fortune with Lord AngeloFor her poor brother's pardon.

ISABELLA

That's he indeed.

DUKE VINCENTIO

You were not bid to speak.

LUCIO

No, my good lord;Nor wish'd to hold my peace.

DUKE VINCENTIO

I wish you now, then;Pray you, take note of it: and when you haveA business for yourself, pray heaven you thenBe perfect.

LUCIO

I warrant your honour.

DUKE VINCENTIO

The warrants for yourself; take heed to't.

ISABELLA

This gentleman told somewhat of my tale,--

LUCIO

Right.

DUKE VINCENTIO

It may be right; but you are i' the wrongTo speak before your time. Proceed.

ISABELLA

I wentTo this pernicious caitiff deputy,--

DUKE VINCENTIO

That's somewhat madly spoken.

ISABELLA

Pardon it;The phrase is to the matter.

DUKE VINCENTIO

Mended again. The matter; proceed.

ISABELLA

In brief, to set the needless process by,How I persuaded, how I pray'd, and kneel'd,How he refell'd me, and how I replied,--For this was of much length,--the vile conclusionI now begin with grief and shame to utter:He would not, but by gift of my chaste bodyTo his concupiscible intemperate lust,Release my brother; and, after much debatement,My sisterly remorse confutes mine honour,And I did yield to him: but the next morn betimes,His purpose surfeiting, he sends a warrantFor my poor brother's head.

DUKE VINCENTIO

This is most likely!

ISABELLA

O, that it were as like as it is true!

DUKE VINCENTIO

By heaven, fond wretch, thou knowist not what thou speak'st,Or else thou art suborn'd against his honourIn hateful practise. First, his integrityStands without blemish. Next, it imports no reasonThat with such vehemency he should pursueFaults proper to himself: if he had so offended,He would have weigh'd thy brother by himselfAnd not have cut him off. Some one hath set you on:Confess the truth, and say by whose adviceThou camest here to complain.

ISABELLA

And is this all?Then, O you blessed ministers above,Keep me in patience, and with ripen'd timeUnfold the evil which is here wrapt upIn countenance! Heaven shield your grace from woe,As I, thus wrong'd, hence unbelieved go!

DUKE VINCENTIO

I know you'ld fain be gone. An officer!To prison with her! Shall we thus permitA blasting and a scandalous breath to fallOn him so near us? This needs must be a practise.Who knew of Your intent and coming hither?

ISABELLA

One that I would were here, Friar Lodowick.

DUKE VINCENTIO

A ghostly father, belike. Who knows that Lodowick?

LUCIO

My lord, I know him; 'tis a meddling friar;I do not like the man: had he been lay, my lordFor certain words he spake against your graceIn your retirement, I had swinged him soundly.

DUKE VINCENTIO

Words against me? this is a good friar, belike!And to set on this wretched woman hereAgainst our substitute! Let this friar be found.

LUCIO

But yesternight, my lord, she and that friar,I saw them at the prison: a saucy friar,A very scurvy fellow.

FRIAR PETER

Blessed be your royal grace!I have stood by, my lord, and I have heardYour royal ear abused. First, hath this womanMost wrongfully accused your substitute,Who is as free from touch or soil with herAs she from one ungot.

DUKE VINCENTIO

We did believe no less.Know you that Friar Lodowick that she speaks of?

FRIAR PETER

I know him for a man divine and holy;Not scurvy, nor a temporary meddler,As he's reported by this gentleman;And, on my trust, a man that never yetDid, as he vouches, misreport your grace.

LUCIO

My lord, most villanously; believe it.

FRIAR PETER

Well, he in time may come to clear himself;But at this instant he is sick my lord,Of a strange fever. Upon his mere request,Being come to knowledge that there was complaintIntended 'gainst Lord Angelo, came I hither,To speak, as from his mouth, what he doth knowIs true and false; and what he with his oathAnd all probation will make up full clear,Whensoever he's convented. First, for this woman.To justify this worthy nobleman,So vulgarly and personally accused,Her shall you hear disproved to her eyes,Till she herself confess it.

DUKE VINCENTIO

Good friar, let's hear it.ISABELLA is carried off guarded; and MARIANA comes forward
Do you not smile at this, Lord Angelo?O heaven, the vanity of wretched fools!Give us some seats. Come, cousin Angelo;In this I'll be impartial; be you judgeOf your own cause. Is this the witness, friar?First, let her show her face, and after speak.

MARIANA

Pardon, my lord; I will not show my faceUntil my husband bid me.

DUKE VINCENTIO

What, are you married?

MARIANA

No, my lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO

Are you a maid?

MARIANA

No, my lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO

A widow, then?

MARIANA

Neither, my lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO

Why, you are nothing then: neither maid, widow, nor wife?

LUCIO

My lord, she may be a punk; for many of them areneither maid, widow, nor wife.

DUKE VINCENTIO

Silence that fellow: I would he had some causeTo prattle for himself.

LUCIO

Well, my lord.

MARIANA

My lord; I do confess I ne'er was married;And I confess besides I am no maid:I have known my husband; yet my husbandKnows not that ever he knew me.

LUCIO

He was drunk then, my lord: it can be no better.

DUKE VINCENTIO

For the benefit of silence, would thou wert so too!

LUCIO

Well, my lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO

This is no witness for Lord Angelo.

MARIANA

Now I come to't my lordShe that accuses him of fornication,In self-same manner doth accuse my husband,And charges him my lord, with such a timeWhen I'll depose I had him in mine armsWith all the effect of love.

ANGELO

Charges she more than me?

MARIANA

Not that I know.

DUKE VINCENTIO

No? you say your husband.

MARIANA

Why, just, my lord, and that is Angelo,Who thinks he knows that he ne'er knew my body,But knows he thinks that he knows Isabel's.

ANGELO

This is a strange abuse. Let's see thy face.

MARIANA

My husband bids me; now I will unmask.Unveiling
This is that face, thou cruel Angelo,Which once thou sworest was worth the looking on;This is the hand which, with a vow'd contract,Was fast belock'd in thine; this is the bodyThat took away the match from Isabel,And did supply thee at thy garden-houseIn her imagined person.

DUKE VINCENTIO

Know you this woman?

LUCIO

Carnally, she says.

DUKE VINCENTIO

Sirrah, no more!

LUCIO

Enough, my lord.

ANGELO

My lord, I must confess I know this woman:And five years since there was some speech of marriageBetwixt myself and her; which was broke off,Partly for that her promised proportionsCame short of composition, but in chiefFor that her reputation was disvaluedIn levity: since which time of five yearsI never spake with her, saw her, nor heard from her,Upon my faith and honour.

MARIANA

Noble prince,As there comes light from heaven and words from breath,As there is sense in truth and truth in virtue,I am affianced this man's wife as stronglyAs words could make up vows: and, my good lord,But Tuesday night last gone in's garden-houseHe knew me as a wife. As this is true,Let me in safety raise me from my kneesOr else for ever be confixed here,A marble monument!

ANGELO

                  I did but smile till now:Now, good my lord, give me the scope of justiceMy patience here is touch'd. I do perceiveThese poor informal women are no moreBut instruments of some more mightier memberThat sets them on: let me have way, my lord,To find this practise out.

DUKE VINCENTIO

Ay, with my heartAnd punish them to your height of pleasure.Thou foolish friar, and thou pernicious woman,Compact with her that's gone, think'st thou thy oaths,Though they would swear down each particular saint,Were testimonies against his worth and creditThat's seal'd in approbation? You, Lord Escalus,Sit with my cousin; lend him your kind painsTo find out this abuse, whence 'tis derived.There is another friar that set them on;Let him be sent for.

FRIAR PETER

Would he were here, my lord! for he indeedHath set the women on to this complaint:Your provost knows the place where he abidesAnd he may fetch him.

DUKE VINCENTIO

Go do it instantly.Exit Provost
And you, my noble and well-warranted cousin,Whom it concerns to hear this matter forth,Do with your injuries as seems you best,In any chastisement: I for a while will leave you;But stir not you till you have well determinedUpon these slanderers.

ESCALUS

My lord, we'll do it throughly.Exit DUKE
Signior Lucio, did not you say you knew thatFriar Lodowick to be a dishonest person?

LUCIO

'Cucullus non facit monachum:' honest in nothingbut in his clothes; and one that hath spoke mostvillanous speeches of the duke.

ESCALUS

We shall entreat you to abide here till he come andenforce them against him: we shall find this friar anotable fellow.

LUCIO

As any in Vienna, on my word.

ESCALUS

Call that same Isabel here once again; I would speak with her.Exit an Attendant
Pray you, my lord, give me leave to question; youshall see how I'll handle her.

LUCIO

Not better than he, by her own report.

ESCALUS

Say you?

LUCIO

Marry, sir, I think, if you handled her privately,she would sooner confess: perchance, publicly,she'll be ashamed.

ESCALUS

I will go darkly to work with her.

LUCIO

That's the way; for women are light at midnight.Re-enter Officers with ISABELLA; and Provost with the DUKE VINCENTIO in his friar's habit


ESCALUS

Come on, mistress: here's a gentlewoman denies allthat you have said.

LUCIO

My lord, here comes the rascal I spoke of; here withthe provost.

ESCALUS

In very good time: speak not you to him till wecall upon you.

LUCIO

Mum.

ESCALUS

Come, sir: did you set these women on to slanderLord Angelo? they have confessed you did.

DUKE VINCENTIO

'Tis false.

ESCALUS

How! know you where you are?

DUKE VINCENTIO

Respect to your great place! and let the devilBe sometime honour'd for his burning throne!Where is the duke? 'tis he should hear me speak.

ESCALUS

The duke's in us; and we will hear you speak:Look you speak justly.

DUKE VINCENTIO

Boldly, at least. But, O, poor souls,Come you to seek the lamb here of the fox?Good night to your redress! Is the duke gone?Then is your cause gone too. The duke's unjust,Thus to retort your manifest appeal,And put your trial in the villain's mouthWhich here you come to accuse.

LUCIO

This is the rascal; this is he I spoke of.

ESCALUS

Why, thou unreverend and unhallow'd friar,Is't not enough thou hast suborn'd these womenTo accuse this worthy man, but, in foul mouthAnd in the witness of his proper ear,To call him villain? and then to glance from himTo the duke himself, to tax him with injustice?Take him hence; to the rack with him! We'll touse youJoint by joint, but we will know his purpose.What 'unjust'!

DUKE VINCENTIO

                  Be not so hot; the dukeDare no more stretch this finger of mine than heDare rack his own: his subject am I not,Nor here provincial. My business in this stateMade me a looker on here in Vienna,Where I have seen corruption boil and bubbleTill it o'er-run the stew; laws for all faults,But faults so countenanced, that the strong statutesStand like the forfeits in a barber's shop,As much in mock as mark.

ESCALUS

Slander to the state! Away with him to prison!

ANGELO

What can you vouch against him, Signior Lucio?Is this the man that you did tell us of?

LUCIO

'Tis he, my lord. Come hither, goodman baldpate:do you know me?

DUKE VINCENTIO

I remember you, sir, by the sound of your voice: Imet you at the prison, in the absence of the duke.

LUCIO

O, did you so? And do you remember what you said of the duke?

DUKE VINCENTIO

Most notedly, sir.

LUCIO

Do you so, sir? And was the duke a fleshmonger, afool, and a coward, as you then reported him to be?

DUKE VINCENTIO

You must, sir, change persons with me, ere you makethat my report: you, indeed, spoke so of him; andmuch more, much worse.

LUCIO

O thou damnable fellow! Did not I pluck thee by thenose for thy speeches?

DUKE VINCENTIO

I protest I love the duke as I love myself.

ANGELO

Hark, how the villain would close now, after histreasonable abuses!

ESCALUS

Such a fellow is not to be talked withal. Away withhim to prison! Where is the provost? Away with himto prison! lay bolts enough upon him: let himspeak no more. Away with those giglots too, andwith the other confederate companion!

DUKE VINCENTIO

[To Provost]  Stay, sir; stay awhile.

ANGELO

What, resists he? Help him, Lucio.

LUCIO

Come, sir; come, sir; come, sir; foh, sir! Why, youbald-pated, lying rascal, you must be hooded, mustyou? Show your knave's visage, with a pox to you!show your sheep-biting face, and be hanged an hour!Will't not off?Pulls off the friar's hood, and discovers DUKE VINCENTIO


DUKE VINCENTIO

Thou art the first knave that e'er madest a duke.First, provost, let me bail these gentle three.To LUCIO
Sneak not away, sir; for the friar and youMust have a word anon. Lay hold on him.

LUCIO

This may prove worse than hanging.

DUKE VINCENTIO

[To ESCALUS]  What you have spoke I pardon: sit you down:We'll borrow place of him.To ANGELO
Sir, by your leave.Hast thou or word, or wit, or impudence,That yet can do thee office? If thou hast,Rely upon it till my tale be heard,And hold no longer out.

ANGELO

O my dread lord,I should be guiltier than my guiltiness,To think I can be undiscernible,When I perceive your grace, like power divine,Hath look'd upon my passes. Then, good prince,No longer session hold upon my shame,But let my trial be mine own confession:Immediate sentence then and sequent deathIs all the grace I beg.

DUKE VINCENTIO

Come hither, Mariana.Say, wast thou e'er contracted to this woman?

ANGELO

I was, my lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO

Go take her hence, and marry her instantly.Do you the office, friar; which consummate,Return him here again. Go with him, provost.Exeunt ANGELO, MARIANA, FRIAR PETER and Provost


ESCALUS

My lord, I am more amazed at his dishonourThan at the strangeness of it.

DUKE VINCENTIO

Come hither, Isabel.Your friar is now your prince: as I was thenAdvertising and holy to your business,Not changing heart with habit, I am stillAttorney'd at your service.

ISABELLA

O, give me pardon,That I, your vassal, have employ'd and pain'dYour unknown sovereignty!

DUKE VINCENTIO

You are pardon'd, Isabel:And now, dear maid, be you as free to us.Your brother's death, I know, sits at your heart;And you may marvel why I obscured myself,Labouring to save his life, and would not ratherMake rash remonstrance of my hidden powerThan let him so be lost. O most kind maid,It was the swift celerity of his death,Which I did think with slower foot came on,That brain'd my purpose. But, peace be with him!That life is better life, past fearing death,Than that which lives to fear: make it your comfort,So happy is your brother.

ISABELLA

I do, my lord.Re-enter ANGELO, MARIANA, FRIAR PETER, and Provost


DUKE VINCENTIO

For this new-married man approaching here,Whose salt imagination yet hath wrong'dYour well defended honour, you must pardonFor Mariana's sake: but as he adjudged your brother,--Being criminal, in double violationOf sacred chastity and of promise-breachThereon dependent, for your brother's life,--The very mercy of the law cries outMost audible, even from his proper tongue,'An Angelo for Claudio, death for death!'Haste still pays haste, and leisure answers leisure;Like doth quit like, and MEASURE still FOR MEASURE.Then, Angelo, thy fault's thus manifested;Which, though thou wouldst deny, denies thee vantage.We do condemn thee to the very blockWhere Claudio stoop'd to death, and with like haste.Away with him!

MARIANA

                  O my most gracious lord,I hope you will not mock me with a husband.

DUKE VINCENTIO

It is your husband mock'd you with a husband.Consenting to the safeguard of your honour,I thought your marriage fit; else imputation,For that he knew you, might reproach your lifeAnd choke your good to come; for his possessions,Although by confiscation they are ours,We do instate and widow you withal,To buy you a better husband.

MARIANA

O my dear lord,I crave no other, nor no better man.

DUKE VINCENTIO

Never crave him; we are definitive.

MARIANA

Gentle my liege,--Kneeling


DUKE VINCENTIO

                  You do but lose your labour.Away with him to death!To LUCIO
Now, sir, to you.

MARIANA

O my good lord! Sweet Isabel, take my part;Lend me your knees, and all my life to comeI'll lend you all my life to do you service.

DUKE VINCENTIO

Against all sense you do importune her:Should she kneel down in mercy of this fact,Her brother's ghost his paved bed would break,And take her hence in horror.

MARIANA

Isabel,Sweet Isabel, do yet but kneel by me;Hold up your hands, say nothing; I'll speak all.They say, best men are moulded out of faults;And, for the most, become much more the betterFor being a little bad: so may my husband.O Isabel, will you not lend a knee?

DUKE VINCENTIO

He dies for Claudio's death.

ISABELLA

Most bounteous sir,Kneeling
Look, if it please you, on this man condemn'd,As if my brother lived: I partly thinkA due sincerity govern'd his deeds,Till he did look on me: since it is so,Let him not die. My brother had but justice,In that he did the thing for which he died:For Angelo,His act did not o'ertake his bad intent,And must be buried but as an intentThat perish'd by the way: thoughts are no subjects;Intents but merely thoughts.

MARIANA

Merely, my lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO

Your suit's unprofitable; stand up, I say.I have bethought me of another fault.Provost, how came it Claudio was beheadedAt an unusual hour?

Provost

It was commanded so.

DUKE VINCENTIO

Had you a special warrant for the deed?

Provost

No, my good lord; it was by private message.

DUKE VINCENTIO

For which I do discharge you of your office:Give up your keys.

Provost

                  Pardon me, noble lord:I thought it was a fault, but knew it not;Yet did repent me, after more advice;For testimony whereof, one in the prison,That should by private order else have died,I have reserved alive.

DUKE VINCENTIO

What's he?

Provost

His name is Barnardine.

DUKE VINCENTIO

I would thou hadst done so by Claudio.Go fetch him hither; let me look upon him.Exit Provost


ESCALUS

I am sorry, one so learned and so wiseAs you, Lord Angelo, have still appear'd,Should slip so grossly, both in the heat of blood.And lack of temper'd judgment afterward.

ANGELO

I am sorry that such sorrow I procure:And so deep sticks it in my penitent heartThat I crave death more willingly than mercy;'Tis my deserving, and I do entreat it.Re-enter Provost, with BARNARDINE, CLAUDIO muffled, and JULIET


DUKE VINCENTIO

Which is that Barnardine?

Provost

This, my lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO

There was a friar told me of this man.Sirrah, thou art said to have a stubborn soul.That apprehends no further than this world,And squarest thy life according. Thou'rt condemn'd:But, for those earthly faults, I quit them all;And pray thee take this mercy to provideFor better times to come. Friar, advise him;I leave him to your hand. What muffled fellow's that?

Provost

This is another prisoner that I saved.Who should have died when Claudio lost his head;As like almost to Claudio as himself.Unmuffles CLAUDIO


DUKE VINCENTIO

[To ISABELLA]  If he be like your brother, for his sakeIs he pardon'd; and, for your lovely sake,Give me your hand and say you will be mine.He is my brother too: but fitter time for that.By this Lord Angelo perceives he's safe;Methinks I see a quickening in his eye.Well, Angelo, your evil quits you well:Look that you love your wife; her worth worth yours.I find an apt remission in myself;And yet here's one in place I cannot pardon.To LUCIO
You, sirrah, that knew me for a fool, a coward,One all of luxury, an ass, a madman;Wherein have I so deserved of you,That you extol me thus?

LUCIO

'Faith, my lord. I spoke it but according to thetrick. If you will hang me for it, you may; but Ihad rather it would please you I might be whipt.

DUKE VINCENTIO

Whipt first, sir, and hanged after.Proclaim it, provost, round about the city.Is any woman wrong'd by this lewd fellow,As I have heard him swear himself there's oneWhom he begot with child, let her appear,And he shall marry her: the nuptial finish'd,Let him be whipt and hang'd.

LUCIO

I beseech your highness, do not marry me to a whore.Your highness said even now, I made you a duke:good my lord, do not recompense me in making me a cuckold.

DUKE VINCENTIO

Upon mine honour, thou shalt marry her.Thy slanders I forgive; and therewithalRemit thy other forfeits. Take him to prison;And see our pleasure herein executed.

LUCIO

Marrying a punk, my lord, is pressing to death,whipping, and hanging.

DUKE VINCENTIO

Slandering a prince deserves it.Exit Officers with LUCIO
She, Claudio, that you wrong'd, look you restore.Joy to you, Mariana! Love her, Angelo:I have confess'd her and I know her virtue.Thanks, good friend Escalus, for thy much goodness:There's more behind that is more gratulate.Thanks, provost, for thy care and secrecy:We shill employ thee in a worthier place.Forgive him, Angelo, that brought you homeThe head of Ragozine for Claudio's:The offence pardons itself. Dear Isabel,I have a motion much imports your good;Whereto if you'll a willing ear incline,What's mine is yours and what is yours is mine.So, bring us to our palace; where we'll showWhat's yet behind, that's meet you all should know.Exeunt
