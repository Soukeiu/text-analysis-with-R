ACT I
SCENE I. Rome. A street.

Enter a company of mutinous Citizens, with staves, clubs, and other weapons


First Citizen

Before we proceed any further, hear me speak.

All

Speak, speak.

First Citizen

You are all resolved rather to die than to famish?

All

Resolved. resolved.

First Citizen

First, you know Caius Marcius is chief enemy to the people.

All

We know't, we know't.

First Citizen

Let us kill him, and we'll have corn at our own price.Is't a verdict?

All

No more talking on't; let it be done: away, away!

Second Citizen

One word, good citizens.

First Citizen

We are accounted poor citizens, the patricians good.What authority surfeits on would relieve us: if theywould yield us but the superfluity, while it werewholesome, we might guess they relieved us humanely;but they think we are too dear: the leanness thatafflicts us, the object of our misery, is as aninventory to particularise their abundance; oursufferance is a gain to them Let us revenge this withour pikes, ere we become rakes: for the gods know Ispeak this in hunger for bread, not in thirst for revenge.

Second Citizen

Would you proceed especially against Caius Marcius?

All

Against him first: he's a very dog to the commonalty.

Second Citizen

Consider you what services he has done for his country?

First Citizen

Very well; and could be content to give him goodreport fort, but that he pays himself with being proud.

Second Citizen

Nay, but speak not maliciously.

First Citizen

I say unto you, what he hath done famously, he didit to that end: though soft-conscienced men can becontent to say it was for his country he did it toplease his mother and to be partly proud; which heis, even till the altitude of his virtue.

Second Citizen

What he cannot help in his nature, you account avice in him. You must in no way say he is covetous.

First Citizen

If I must not, I need not be barren of accusations;he hath faults, with surplus, to tire in repetition.Shouts within
What shouts are these? The other side o' the cityis risen: why stay we prating here? to the Capitol!

All

Come, come.

First Citizen

Soft! who comes here?Enter MENENIUS AGRIPPA


Second Citizen

Worthy Menenius Agrippa; one that hath always lovedthe people.

First Citizen

He's one honest enough: would all the rest were so!

MENENIUS

What work's, my countrymen, in hand? where go youWith bats and clubs? The matter? speak, I pray you.

First Citizen

Our business is not unknown to the senate; they havehad inkling this fortnight what we intend to do,which now we'll show 'em in deeds. They say poorsuitors have strong breaths: they shall know wehave strong arms too.

MENENIUS

Why, masters, my good friends, mine honest neighbours,Will you undo yourselves?

First Citizen

We cannot, sir, we are undone already.

MENENIUS

I tell you, friends, most charitable careHave the patricians of you. For your wants,Your suffering in this dearth, you may as wellStrike at the heaven with your staves as lift themAgainst the Roman state, whose course will onThe way it takes, cracking ten thousand curbsOf more strong link asunder than can everAppear in your impediment. For the dearth,The gods, not the patricians, make it, andYour knees to them, not arms, must help. Alack,You are transported by calamityThither where more attends you, and you slanderThe helms o' the state, who care for you like fathers,When you curse them as enemies.

First Citizen

Care for us! True, indeed! They ne'er cared for usyet: suffer us to famish, and their store-housescrammed with grain; make edicts for usury, tosupport usurers; repeal daily any wholesome actestablished against the rich, and provide morepiercing statutes daily, to chain up and restrainthe poor. If the wars eat us not up, they will; andthere's all the love they bear us.

MENENIUS

Either you mustConfess yourselves wondrous malicious,Or be accused of folly. I shall tell youA pretty tale: it may be you have heard it;But, since it serves my purpose, I will ventureTo stale 't a little more.

First Citizen

Well, I'll hear it, sir: yet you must not think tofob off our disgrace with a tale: but, an 't pleaseyou, deliver.

MENENIUS

There was a time when all the body's membersRebell'd against the belly, thus accused it:That only like a gulf it did remainI' the midst o' the body, idle and unactive,Still cupboarding the viand, never bearingLike labour with the rest, where the other instrumentsDid see and hear, devise, instruct, walk, feel,And, mutually participate, did ministerUnto the appetite and affection commonOf the whole body. The belly answer'd--

First Citizen

Well, sir, what answer made the belly?

MENENIUS

Sir, I shall tell you. With a kind of smile,Which ne'er came from the lungs, but even thus--For, look you, I may make the belly smileAs well as speak--it tauntingly repliedTo the discontented members, the mutinous partsThat envied his receipt; even so most fitlyAs you malign our senators for thatThey are not such as you.

First Citizen

Your belly's answer? What!The kingly-crowned head, the vigilant eye,The counsellor heart, the arm our soldier,Our steed the leg, the tongue our trumpeter.With other muniments and petty helpsIn this our fabric, if that they--

MENENIUS

What then?'Fore me, this fellow speaks! What then? what then?

First Citizen

Should by the cormorant belly be restrain'd,Who is the sink o' the body,--

MENENIUS

Well, what then?

First Citizen

The former agents, if they did complain,What could the belly answer?

MENENIUS

I will tell youIf you'll bestow a small--of what you have little--Patience awhile, you'll hear the belly's answer.

First Citizen

Ye're long about it.

MENENIUS

Note me this, good friend;Your most grave belly was deliberate,Not rash like his accusers, and thus answer'd:'True is it, my incorporate friends,' quoth he,'That I receive the general food at first,Which you do live upon; and fit it is,Because I am the store-house and the shopOf the whole body: but, if you do remember,I send it through the rivers of your blood,Even to the court, the heart, to the seat o' the brain;And, through the cranks and offices of man,The strongest nerves and small inferior veinsFrom me receive that natural competencyWhereby they live: and though that all at once,You, my good friends,'--this says the belly, mark me,--

First Citizen

Ay, sir; well, well.

MENENIUS

'Though all at once cannotSee what I do deliver out to each,Yet I can make my audit up, that allFrom me do back receive the flour of all,And leave me but the bran.' What say you to't?

First Citizen

It was an answer: how apply you this?

MENENIUS

The senators of Rome are this good belly,And you the mutinous members; for examineTheir counsels and their cares, digest things rightlyTouching the weal o' the common, you shall findNo public benefit which you receiveBut it proceeds or comes from them to youAnd no way from yourselves. What do you think,You, the great toe of this assembly?

First Citizen

I the great toe! why the great toe?

MENENIUS

For that, being one o' the lowest, basest, poorest,Of this most wise rebellion, thou go'st foremost:Thou rascal, that art worst in blood to run,Lead'st first to win some vantage.But make you ready your stiff bats and clubs:Rome and her rats are at the point of battle;The one side must have bale.Enter CAIUS MARCIUS
Hail, noble Marcius!

MARCIUS

Thanks. What's the matter, you dissentious rogues,That, rubbing the poor itch of your opinion,Make yourselves scabs?

First Citizen

We have ever your good word.

MARCIUS

He that will give good words to thee will flatterBeneath abhorring. What would you have, you curs,That like nor peace nor war? the one affrights you,The other makes you proud. He that trusts to you,Where he should find you lions, finds you hares;Where foxes, geese: you are no surer, no,Than is the coal of fire upon the ice,Or hailstone in the sun. Your virtue isTo make him worthy whose offence subdues himAnd curse that justice did it.Who deserves greatnessDeserves your hate; and your affections areA sick man's appetite, who desires most thatWhich would increase his evil. He that dependsUpon your favours swims with fins of leadAnd hews down oaks with rushes. Hang ye! Trust Ye?With every minute you do change a mind,And call him noble that was now your hate,Him vile that was your garland. What's the matter,That in these several places of the cityYou cry against the noble senate, who,Under the gods, keep you in awe, which elseWould feed on one another? What's their seeking?

MENENIUS

For corn at their own rates; whereof, they say,The city is well stored.

MARCIUS

Hang 'em! They say!They'll sit by the fire, and presume to knowWhat's done i' the Capitol; who's like to rise,Who thrives and who declines; side factionsand give outConjectural marriages; making parties strongAnd feebling such as stand not in their likingBelow their cobbled shoes. They say there'sgrain enough!Would the nobility lay aside their ruth,And let me use my sword, I'll make a quarryWith thousands of these quarter'd slaves, as highAs I could pick my lance.

MENENIUS

Nay, these are almost thoroughly persuaded;For though abundantly they lack discretion,Yet are they passing cowardly. But, I beseech you,What says the other troop?

MARCIUS

They are dissolved: hang 'em!They said they were an-hungry; sigh'd forth proverbs,That hunger broke stone walls, that dogs must eat,That meat was made for mouths, that the gods sent notCorn for the rich men only: with these shredsThey vented their complainings; which being answer'd,And a petition granted them, a strange one--To break the heart of generosity,And make bold power look pale--they threw their capsAs they would hang them on the horns o' the moon,Shouting their emulation.

MENENIUS

What is granted them?

MARCIUS

Five tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms,Of their own choice: one's Junius Brutus,Sicinius Velutus, and I know not--'Sdeath!The rabble should have first unroof'd the city,Ere so prevail'd with me: it will in timeWin upon power and throw forth greater themesFor insurrection's arguing.

MENENIUS

This is strange.

MARCIUS

Go, get you home, you fragments!Enter a Messenger, hastily


Messenger

Where's Caius Marcius?

MARCIUS

Here: what's the matter?

Messenger

The news is, sir, the Volsces are in arms.

MARCIUS

I am glad on 't: then we shall ha' means to ventOur musty superfluity. See, our best elders.Enter COMINIUS, TITUS LARTIUS, and other Senators; JUNIUS BRUTUS and SICINIUS VELUTUS


First Senator

Marcius, 'tis true that you have lately told us;The Volsces are in arms.

MARCIUS

They have a leader,Tullus Aufidius, that will put you to 't.I sin in envying his nobility,And were I any thing but what I am,I would wish me only he.

COMINIUS

You have fought together.

MARCIUS

Were half to half the world by the ears and he.Upon my party, I'ld revolt to makeOnly my wars with him: he is a lionThat I am proud to hunt.

First Senator

Then, worthy Marcius,Attend upon Cominius to these wars.

COMINIUS

It is your former promise.

MARCIUS

Sir, it is;And I am constant. Titus Lartius, thouShalt see me once more strike at Tullus' face.What, art thou stiff? stand'st out?

TITUS

No, Caius Marcius;I'll lean upon one crutch and fight with t'other,Ere stay behind this business.

MENENIUS

O, true-bred!

First Senator

Your company to the Capitol; where, I know,Our greatest friends attend us.

TITUS

[To COMINIUS]                Lead you on.To MARCIUS
Right worthy you priority.

COMINIUS

Noble Marcius!

First Senator

[To the Citizens]  Hence to your homes; be gone!

MARCIUS

Nay, let them follow:The Volsces have much corn; take these rats thitherTo gnaw their garners. Worshipful mutiners,Your valour puts well forth: pray, follow.Citizens steal away. Exeunt all but SICINIUS and BRUTUS


SICINIUS

Was ever man so proud as is this Marcius?

BRUTUS

He has no equal.

SICINIUS

When we were chosen tribunes for the people,--

BRUTUS

Mark'd you his lip and eyes?

SICINIUS

Nay. but his taunts.

BRUTUS

Being moved, he will not spare to gird the gods.

SICINIUS

Be-mock the modest moon.

BRUTUS

The present wars devour him: he is grownToo proud to be so valiant.

SICINIUS

Such a nature,Tickled with good success, disdains the shadowWhich he treads on at noon: but I do wonderHis insolence can brook to be commandedUnder Cominius.

BRUTUS

Fame, at the which he aims,In whom already he's well graced, can notBetter be held nor more attain'd than byA place below the first: for what miscarriesShall be the general's fault, though he performTo the utmost of a man, and giddy censureWill then cry out of Marcius 'O if heHad borne the business!'

SICINIUS

Besides, if things go well,Opinion that so sticks on Marcius shallOf his demerits rob Cominius.

BRUTUS

Come:Half all Cominius' honours are to Marcius.Though Marcius earned them not, and all his faultsTo Marcius shall be honours, though indeedIn aught he merit not.

SICINIUS

Let's hence, and hearHow the dispatch is made, and in what fashion,More than his singularity, he goesUpon this present action.

BRUTUS

Lets along.Exeunt

SCENE II. Corioli. The Senate-house.

Enter TULLUS AUFIDIUS and certain Senators


First Senator

So, your opinion is, Aufidius,That they of Rome are entered in our counselsAnd know how we proceed.

AUFIDIUS

Is it not yours?What ever have been thought on in this state,That could be brought to bodily act ere RomeHad circumvention? 'Tis not four days goneSince I heard thence; these are the words: I thinkI have the letter here; yes, here it is.Reads
'They have press'd a power, but it is not knownWhether for east or west: the dearth is great;The people mutinous; and it is rumour'd,Cominius, Marcius your old enemy,Who is of Rome worse hated than of you,And Titus Lartius, a most valiant Roman,These three lead on this preparationWhither 'tis bent: most likely 'tis for you:Consider of it.'

First Senator

                  Our army's in the fieldWe never yet made doubt but Rome was readyTo answer us.

AUFIDIUS

                  Nor did you think it follyTo keep your great pretences veil'd till whenThey needs must show themselves; whichin the hatching,It seem'd, appear'd to Rome. By the discovery.We shall be shorten'd in our aim, which wasTo take in many towns ere almost RomeShould know we were afoot.

Second Senator

Noble Aufidius,Take your commission; hie you to your bands:Let us alone to guard Corioli:If they set down before 's, for the removeBring your army; but, I think, you'll findThey've not prepared for us.

AUFIDIUS

O, doubt not that;I speak from certainties. Nay, more,Some parcels of their power are forth already,And only hitherward. I leave your honours.If we and Caius Marcius chance to meet,'Tis sworn between us we shall ever strikeTill one can do no more.

All

The gods assist you!

AUFIDIUS

And keep your honours safe!

First Senator

Farewell.

Second Senator

Farewell.

All

Farewell.Exeunt

SCENE III. Rome. A room in Marcius' house.

Enter VOLUMNIA and VIRGILIA	they set them down on two low stools, and sew


VOLUMNIA

I pray you, daughter, sing; or express yourself in amore comfortable sort: if my son were my husband, Ishould freelier rejoice in that absence wherein hewon honour than in the embracements of his bed wherehe would show most love. When yet he was buttender-bodied and the only son of my womb, whenyouth with comeliness plucked all gaze his way, whenfor a day of kings' entreaties a mother should notsell him an hour from her beholding, I, consideringhow honour would become such a person. that it wasno better than picture-like to hang by the wall, ifrenown made it not stir, was pleased to let him seekdanger where he was like to find fame. To a cruelwar I sent him; from whence he returned, his browsbound with oak. I tell thee, daughter, I sprang notmore in joy at first hearing he was a man-childthan now in first seeing he had proved himself aman.

VIRGILIA

But had he died in the business, madam; how then?

VOLUMNIA

Then his good report should have been my son; Itherein would have found issue. Hear me professsincerely: had I a dozen sons, each in my lovealike and none less dear than thine and my goodMarcius, I had rather had eleven die nobly for theircountry than one voluptuously surfeit out of action.Enter a Gentlewoman


Gentlewoman

Madam, the Lady Valeria is come to visit you.

VIRGILIA

Beseech you, give me leave to retire myself.

VOLUMNIA

Indeed, you shall not.Methinks I hear hither your husband's drum,See him pluck Aufidius down by the hair,As children from a bear, the Volsces shunning him:Methinks I see him stamp thus, and call thus:'Come on, you cowards! you were got in fear,Though you were born in Rome:' his bloody browWith his mail'd hand then wiping, forth he goes,Like to a harvest-man that's task'd to mowOr all or lose his hire.

VIRGILIA

His bloody brow! O Jupiter, no blood!

VOLUMNIA

Away, you fool! it more becomes a manThan gilt his trophy: the breasts of Hecuba,When she did suckle Hector, look'd not lovelierThan Hector's forehead when it spit forth bloodAt Grecian sword, contemning. Tell Valeria,We are fit to bid her welcome.Exit Gentlewoman


VIRGILIA

Heavens bless my lord from fell Aufidius!

VOLUMNIA

He'll beat Aufidius 'head below his kneeAnd tread upon his neck.Enter VALERIA, with an Usher and Gentlewoman


VALERIA

My ladies both, good day to you.

VOLUMNIA

Sweet madam.

VIRGILIA

I am glad to see your ladyship.

VALERIA

How do you both? you are manifest house-keepers.What are you sewing here? A fine spot, in goodfaith. How does your little son?

VIRGILIA

I thank your ladyship; well, good madam.

VOLUMNIA

He had rather see the swords, and hear a drum, thanlook upon his school-master.

VALERIA

O' my word, the father's son: I'll swear,'tis avery pretty boy. O' my troth, I looked upon him o'Wednesday half an hour together: has such aconfirmed countenance. I saw him run after a gildedbutterfly: and when he caught it, he let it goagain; and after it again; and over and over hecomes, and again; catched it again; or whether hisfall enraged him, or how 'twas, he did so set histeeth and tear it; O, I warrant it, how he mammockedit!

VOLUMNIA

One on 's father's moods.

VALERIA

Indeed, la, 'tis a noble child.

VIRGILIA

A crack, madam.

VALERIA

Come, lay aside your stitchery; I must have you playthe idle husewife with me this afternoon.

VIRGILIA

No, good madam; I will not out of doors.

VALERIA

Not out of doors!

VOLUMNIA

She shall, she shall.

VIRGILIA

Indeed, no, by your patience; I'll not over thethreshold till my lord return from the wars.

VALERIA

Fie, you confine yourself most unreasonably: come,you must go visit the good lady that lies in.

VIRGILIA

I will wish her speedy strength, and visit her withmy prayers; but I cannot go thither.

VOLUMNIA

Why, I pray you?

VIRGILIA

'Tis not to save labour, nor that I want love.

VALERIA

You would be another Penelope: yet, they say, allthe yarn she spun in Ulysses' absence did but fillIthaca full of moths. Come; I would your cambricwere sensible as your finger, that you might leavepricking it for pity. Come, you shall go with us.

VIRGILIA

No, good madam, pardon me; indeed, I will not forth.

VALERIA

In truth, la, go with me; and I'll tell youexcellent news of your husband.

VIRGILIA

O, good madam, there can be none yet.

VALERIA

Verily, I do not jest with you; there came news fromhim last night.

VIRGILIA

Indeed, madam?

VALERIA

In earnest, it's true; I heard a senator speak it.Thus it is: the Volsces have an army forth; againstwhom Cominius the general is gone, with one part ofour Roman power: your lord and Titus Lartius are setdown before their city Corioli; they nothing doubtprevailing and to make it brief wars. This is true,on mine honour; and so, I pray, go with us.

VIRGILIA

Give me excuse, good madam; I will obey you in everything hereafter.

VOLUMNIA

Let her alone, lady: as she is now, she will butdisease our better mirth.

VALERIA

In troth, I think she would. Fare you well, then.Come, good sweet lady. Prithee, Virgilia, turn thysolemness out o' door. and go along with us.

VIRGILIA

No, at a word, madam; indeed, I must not. I wishyou much mirth.

VALERIA

Well, then, farewell.Exeunt

SCENE IV. Before Corioli.

Enter, with drum and colours, MARCIUS, TITUS  LARTIUS, Captains and Soldiers. To them a Messenger


MARCIUS

Yonder comes news. A wager they have met.

LARTIUS

My horse to yours, no.

MARCIUS

'Tis done.

LARTIUS

Agreed.

MARCIUS

Say, has our general met the enemy?

Messenger

They lie in view; but have not spoke as yet.

LARTIUS

So, the good horse is mine.

MARCIUS

I'll buy him of you.

LARTIUS

No, I'll nor sell nor give him: lend you him I willFor half a hundred years. Summon the town.

MARCIUS

How far off lie these armies?

Messenger

Within this mile and half.

MARCIUS

Then shall we hear their 'larum, and they ours.Now, Mars, I prithee, make us quick in work,That we with smoking swords may march from hence,To help our fielded friends! Come, blow thy blast.They sound a parley. Enter two Senators with others on the walls
Tutus Aufidius, is he within your walls?

First Senator

No, nor a man that fears you less than he,That's lesser than a little.Drums afar off
Hark! our drumsAre bringing forth our youth. We'll break our walls,Rather than they shall pound us up: our gates,Which yet seem shut, we, have but pinn'd with rushes;They'll open of themselves.Alarum afar off
Hark you. far off!There is Aufidius; list, what work he makesAmongst your cloven army.

MARCIUS

O, they are at it!

LARTIUS

Their noise be our instruction. Ladders, ho!Enter the army of the Volsces


MARCIUS

They fear us not, but issue forth their city.Now put your shields before your hearts, and fightWith hearts more proof than shields. Advance,brave Titus:They do disdain us much beyond our thoughts,Which makes me sweat with wrath. Come on, my fellows:He that retires I'll take him for a Volsce,And he shall feel mine edge.Alarum. The Romans are beat back to their trenches. Re-enter MARCIUS cursing


MARCIUS

All the contagion of the south light on you,You shames of Rome! you herd of--Boils and plaguesPlaster you o'er, that you may be abhorr'dFurther than seen and one infect anotherAgainst the wind a mile! You souls of geese,That bear the shapes of men, how have you runFrom slaves that apes would beat! Pluto and hell!All hurt behind; backs red, and faces paleWith flight and agued fear! Mend and charge home,Or, by the fires of heaven, I'll leave the foeAnd make my wars on you: look to't: come on;If you'll stand fast, we'll beat them to their wives,As they us to our trenches followed.Another alarum. The Volsces fly, and MARCIUS follows them to the gates
So, now the gates are ope: now prove good seconds:'Tis for the followers fortune widens them,Not for the fliers: mark me, and do the like.Enters the gates


First Soldier

Fool-hardiness; not I.

Second Soldier

Nor I.MARCIUS is shut in


First Soldier

See, they have shut him in.

All

To the pot, I warrant him.Alarum continues
Re-enter TITUS LARTIUS


LARTIUS

What is become of Marcius?

All

Slain, sir, doubtless.

First Soldier

Following the fliers at the very heels,With them he enters; who, upon the sudden,Clapp'd to their gates: he is himself alone,To answer all the city.

LARTIUS

O noble fellow!Who sensibly outdares his senseless sword,And, when it bows, stands up. Thou art left, Marcius:A carbuncle entire, as big as thou art,Were not so rich a jewel. Thou wast a soldierEven to Cato's wish, not fierce and terribleOnly in strokes; but, with thy grim looks andThe thunder-like percussion of thy sounds,Thou madst thine enemies shake, as if the worldWere feverous and did tremble.Re-enter MARCIUS, bleeding, assaulted by the enemy


First Soldier

Look, sir.

LARTIUS

O,'tis Marcius!Let's fetch him off, or make remain alike.They fight, and all enter the city

SCENE V. Corioli. A street.

Enter certain Romans, with spoils


First Roman

This will I carry to Rome.

Second Roman

And I this.

Third Roman

A murrain on't! I took this for silver.Alarum continues still afar off
Enter MARCIUS and TITUS LARTIUS with a trumpet


MARCIUS

See here these movers that do prize their hoursAt a crack'd drachm! Cushions, leaden spoons,Irons of a doit, doublets that hangmen wouldBury with those that wore them, these base slaves,Ere yet the fight be done, pack up: down with them!And hark, what noise the general makes! To him!There is the man of my soul's hate, Aufidius,Piercing our Romans: then, valiant Titus, takeConvenient numbers to make good the city;Whilst I, with those that have the spirit, will hasteTo help Cominius.

LARTIUS

                  Worthy sir, thou bleed'st;Thy exercise hath been too violent forA second course of fight.

MARCIUS

Sir, praise me not;My work hath yet not warm'd me: fare you well:The blood I drop is rather physicalThan dangerous to me: to Aufidius thusI will appear, and fight.

LARTIUS

Now the fair goddess, Fortune,Fall deep in love with thee; and her great charmsMisguide thy opposers' swords! Bold gentleman,Prosperity be thy page!

MARCIUS

Thy friend no lessThan those she placeth highest! So, farewell.

LARTIUS

Thou worthiest Marcius!Exit MARCIUS
Go, sound thy trumpet in the market-place;Call thither all the officers o' the town,Where they shall know our mind: away!Exeunt

SCENE VI. Near the camp of Cominius.

Enter COMINIUS, as it were in retire, with soldiers


COMINIUS

Breathe you, my friends: well fought;we are come offLike Romans, neither foolish in our stands,Nor cowardly in retire: believe me, sirs,We shall be charged again. Whiles we have struck,By interims and conveying gusts we have heardThe charges of our friends. Ye Roman gods!Lead their successes as we wish our own,That both our powers, with smilingfronts encountering,May give you thankful sacrifice.Enter a Messenger
Thy news?

Messenger

The citizens of Corioli have issued,And given to Lartius and to Marcius battle:I saw our party to their trenches driven,And then I came away.

COMINIUS

Though thou speak'st truth,Methinks thou speak'st not well.How long is't since?

Messenger

Above an hour, my lord.

COMINIUS

'Tis not a mile; briefly we heard their drums:How couldst thou in a mile confound an hour,And bring thy news so late?

Messenger

Spies of the VolscesHeld me in chase, that I was forced to wheelThree or four miles about, else had I, sir,Half an hour since brought my report.

COMINIUS

Who's yonder,That does appear as he were flay'd? O godsHe has the stamp of Marcius; and I haveBefore-time seen him thus.

MARCIUS

[Within]                 Come I too late?

COMINIUS

The shepherd knows not thunder from a tabourMore than I know the sound of Marcius' tongueFrom every meaner man.Enter MARCIUS


MARCIUS

Come I too late?

COMINIUS

Ay, if you come not in the blood of others,But mantled in your own.

MARCIUS

O, let me clip yeIn arms as sound as when I woo'd, in heartAs merry as when our nuptial day was done,And tapers burn'd to bedward!

COMINIUS

Flower of warriors,How is it with Titus Lartius?

MARCIUS

As with a man busied about decrees:Condemning some to death, and some to exile;Ransoming him, or pitying, threatening the other;Holding Corioli in the name of Rome,Even like a fawning greyhound in the leash,To let him slip at will.

COMINIUS

Where is that slaveWhich told me they had beat you to your trenches?Where is he? call him hither.

MARCIUS

Let him alone;He did inform the truth: but for our gentlemen,The common file--a plague! tribunes for them!--The mouse ne'er shunn'd the cat as they did budgeFrom rascals worse than they.

COMINIUS

But how prevail'd you?

MARCIUS

Will the time serve to tell? I do not think.Where is the enemy? are you lords o' the field?If not, why cease you till you are so?

COMINIUS

Marcius,We have at disadvantage fought and didRetire to win our purpose.

MARCIUS

How lies their battle? know you on which sideThey have placed their men of trust?

COMINIUS

As I guess, Marcius,Their bands i' the vaward are the Antiates,Of their best trust; o'er them Aufidius,Their very heart of hope.

MARCIUS

I do beseech you,By all the battles wherein we have fought,By the blood we have shed together, by the vowsWe have made to endure friends, that you directlySet me against Aufidius and his Antiates;And that you not delay the present, but,Filling the air with swords advanced and darts,We prove this very hour.

COMINIUS

Though I could wishYou were conducted to a gentle bathAnd balms applied to, you, yet dare I neverDeny your asking: take your choice of thoseThat best can aid your action.

MARCIUS

Those are theyThat most are willing. If any such be here--As it were sin to doubt--that love this paintingWherein you see me smear'd; if any fearLesser his person than an ill report;If any think brave death outweighs bad lifeAnd that his country's dearer than himself;Let him alone, or so many so minded,Wave thus, to express his disposition,And follow Marcius.They all shout and wave their swords, take him up in their arms, and cast up their caps
O, me alone! make you a sword of me?If these shows be not outward, which of youBut is four Volsces? none of you but isAble to bear against the great AufidiusA shield as hard as his. A certain number,Though thanks to all, must I selectfrom all: the restShall bear the business in some other fight,As cause will be obey'd. Please you to march;And four shall quickly draw out my command,Which men are best inclined.

COMINIUS

March on, my fellows:Make good this ostentation, and you shallDivide in all with us.Exeunt

SCENE VII. The gates of Corioli.

TITUS LARTIUS, having set a guard upon  Corioli, going with drum and trumpet toward  COMINIUS and CAIUS MARCIUS, enters with Lieutenant, other Soldiers, and a Scout


LARTIUS

So, let the ports be guarded: keep your duties,As I have set them down. If I do send, dispatchThose centuries to our aid: the rest will serveFor a short holding: if we lose the field,We cannot keep the town.

Lieutenant

Fear not our care, sir.

LARTIUS

Hence, and shut your gates upon's.Our guider, come; to the Roman camp conduct us.Exeunt

SCENE VIII. A field of battle.

Alarum as in battle. Enter, from opposite sides, MARCIUS and AUFIDIUS


MARCIUS

I'll fight with none but thee; for I do hate theeWorse than a promise-breaker.

AUFIDIUS

We hate alike:Not Afric owns a serpent I abhorMore than thy fame and envy. Fix thy foot.

MARCIUS

Let the first budger die the other's slave,And the gods doom him after!

AUFIDIUS

If I fly, Marcius,Holloa me like a hare.

MARCIUS

Within these three hours, Tullus,Alone I fought in your Corioli walls,And made what work I pleased: 'tis not my bloodWherein thou seest me mask'd; for thy revengeWrench up thy power to the highest.

AUFIDIUS

Wert thou the HectorThat was the whip of your bragg'd progeny,Thou shouldst not scape me here.They fight, and certain Volsces come to the aid of  AUFIDIUS. MARCIUS fights till they be driven in breathless
Officious, and not valiant, you have shamed meIn your condemned seconds.Exeunt

SCENE IX. The Roman camp.

Flourish. Alarum. A retreat is sounded. Flourish.  Enter, from one side, COMINIUS with the Romans; from the other side, MARCIUS, with his arm in a scarf


COMINIUS

If I should tell thee o'er this thy day's work,Thou'ldst not believe thy deeds: but I'll report itWhere senators shall mingle tears with smiles,Where great patricians shall attend and shrug,I' the end admire, where ladies shall be frighted,And, gladly quaked, hear more; where thedull tribunes,That, with the fusty plebeians, hate thine honours,Shall say against their hearts 'We thank the godsOur Rome hath such a soldier.'Yet camest thou to a morsel of this feast,Having fully dined before.Enter TITUS LARTIUS, with his power, from the pursuit


LARTIUS

O general,Here is the steed, we the caparison:Hadst thou beheld--

MARCIUS

Pray now, no more: my mother,Who has a charter to extol her blood,When she does praise me grieves me. I have doneAs you have done; that's what I can; inducedAs you have been; that's for my country:He that has but effected his good willHath overta'en mine act.

COMINIUS

You shall not beThe grave of your deserving; Rome must knowThe value of her own: 'twere a concealmentWorse than a theft, no less than a traducement,To hide your doings; and to silence that,Which, to the spire and top of praises vouch'd,Would seem but modest: therefore, I beseech youIn sign of what you are, not to rewardWhat you have done--before our army hear me.

MARCIUS

I have some wounds upon me, and they smartTo hear themselves remember'd.

COMINIUS

Should they not,Well might they fester 'gainst ingratitude,And tent themselves with death. Of all the horses,Whereof we have ta'en good and good store, of allThe treasure in this field achieved and city,We render you the tenth, to be ta'en forth,Before the common distribution, atYour only choice.

MARCIUS

                  I thank you, general;But cannot make my heart consent to takeA bribe to pay my sword: I do refuse it;And stand upon my common part with thoseThat have beheld the doing.A long flourish. They all cry 'Marcius! Marcius!'  cast up their caps and lances: COMINIUS and LARTIUS stand bare


MARCIUS

May these same instruments, which you profane,Never sound more! when drums and trumpets shallI' the field prove flatterers, let courts and cities beMade all of false-faced soothing!When steel grows soft as the parasite's silk,Let him be made a coverture for the wars!No more, I say! For that I have not wash'dMy nose that bled, or foil'd some debile wretch.--Which, without note, here's many else have done,--You shout me forthIn acclamations hyperbolical;As if I loved my little should be dietedIn praises sauced with lies.

COMINIUS

Too modest are you;More cruel to your good report than gratefulTo us that give you truly: by your patience,If 'gainst yourself you be incensed, we'll put you,Like one that means his proper harm, in manacles,Then reason safely with you. Therefore, be it known,As to us, to all the world, that Caius MarciusWears this war's garland: in token of the which,My noble steed, known to the camp, I give him,With all his trim belonging; and from this time,For what he did before Corioli, call him,With all the applause and clamour of the host,CAIUS MARCIUS CORIOLANUS! BearThe addition nobly ever!Flourish. Trumpets sound, and drums


All

Caius Marcius Coriolanus!

CORIOLANUS

I will go wash;And when my face is fair, you shall perceiveWhether I blush or no: howbeit, I thank you.I mean to stride your steed, and at all timesTo undercrest your good additionTo the fairness of my power.

COMINIUS

So, to our tent;Where, ere we do repose us, we will writeTo Rome of our success. You, Titus Lartius,Must to Corioli back: send us to RomeThe best, with whom we may articulate,For their own good and ours.

LARTIUS

I shall, my lord.

CORIOLANUS

The gods begin to mock me. I, that nowRefused most princely gifts, am bound to begOf my lord general.

COMINIUS

Take't; 'tis yours. What is't?

CORIOLANUS

I sometime lay here in CorioliAt a poor man's house; he used me kindly:He cried to me; I saw him prisoner;But then Aufidius was with in my view,And wrath o'erwhelm'd my pity: I request youTo give my poor host freedom.

COMINIUS

O, well begg'd!Were he the butcher of my son, he shouldBe free as is the wind. Deliver him, Titus.

LARTIUS

Marcius, his name?

CORIOLANUS

                  By Jupiter! forgot.I am weary; yea, my memory is tired.Have we no wine here?

COMINIUS

Go we to our tent:The blood upon your visage dries; 'tis timeIt should be look'd to: come.Exeunt

SCENE X. The camp of the Volsces.

A flourish. Cornets. Enter TULLUS AUFIDIUS, bloody, with two or three Soldiers


AUFIDIUS

The town is ta'en!

First Soldier

'Twill be deliver'd back on good condition.

AUFIDIUS

Condition!I would I were a Roman; for I cannot,Being a Volsce, be that I am. Condition!What good condition can a treaty findI' the part that is at mercy? Five times, Marcius,I have fought with thee: so often hast thou beat me,And wouldst do so, I think, should we encounterAs often as we eat. By the elements,If e'er again I meet him beard to beard,He's mine, or I am his: mine emulationHath not that honour in't it had; for whereI thought to crush him in an equal force,True sword to sword, I'll potch at him some wayOr wrath or craft may get him.

First Soldier

He's the devil.

AUFIDIUS

Bolder, though not so subtle. My valour's poison'dWith only suffering stain by him; for himShall fly out of itself: nor sleep nor sanctuary,Being naked, sick, nor fane nor Capitol,The prayers of priests nor times of sacrifice,Embarquements all of fury, shall lift upTheir rotten privilege and custom 'gainstMy hate to Marcius: where I find him, were itAt home, upon my brother's guard, even there,Against the hospitable canon, would IWash my fierce hand in's heart. Go you to the city;Learn how 'tis held; and what they are that mustBe hostages for Rome.

First Soldier

Will not you go?

AUFIDIUS

I am attended at the cypress grove: I pray you--'Tis south the city mills--bring me word thitherHow the world goes, that to the pace of itI may spur on my journey.

First Soldier

I shall, sir.Exeunt

ACT II
SCENE I. Rome. A public place.

Enter MENENIUS with the two Tribunes of the people, SICINIUS and BRUTUS.


MENENIUS

The augurer tells me we shall have news to-night.

BRUTUS

Good or bad?

MENENIUS

Not according to the prayer of the people, for theylove not Marcius.

SICINIUS

Nature teaches beasts to know their friends.

MENENIUS

Pray you, who does the wolf love?

SICINIUS

The lamb.

MENENIUS

Ay, to devour him; as the hungry plebeians would thenoble Marcius.

BRUTUS

He's a lamb indeed, that baes like a bear.

MENENIUS

He's a bear indeed, that lives like a lamb. You twoare old men: tell me one thing that I shall ask you.

Both

Well, sir.

MENENIUS

In what enormity is Marcius poor in, that you twohave not in abundance?

BRUTUS

He's poor in no one fault, but stored with all.

SICINIUS

Especially in pride.

BRUTUS

And topping all others in boasting.

MENENIUS

This is strange now: do you two know how you arecensured here in the city, I mean of us o' theright-hand file? do you?

Both

Why, how are we censured?

MENENIUS

Because you talk of pride now,--will you not be angry?

Both

Well, well, sir, well.

MENENIUS

Why, 'tis no great matter; for a very little thief ofoccasion will rob you of a great deal of patience:give your dispositions the reins, and be angry atyour pleasures; at the least if you take it as apleasure to you in being so. You blame Marcius forbeing proud?

BRUTUS

We do it not alone, sir.

MENENIUS

I know you can do very little alone; for your helpsare many, or else your actions would grow wondroussingle: your abilities are too infant-like fordoing much alone. You talk of pride: O that youcould turn your eyes toward the napes of your necks,and make but an interior survey of your good selves!O that you could!

BRUTUS

What then, sir?

MENENIUS

Why, then you should discover a brace of unmeriting,proud, violent, testy magistrates, alias fools, asany in Rome.

SICINIUS

Menenius, you are known well enough too.

MENENIUS

I am known to be a humorous patrician, and one thatloves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allayingTiber in't; said to be something imperfect infavouring the first complaint; hasty and tinder-likeupon too trivial motion; one that converses morewith the buttock of the night than with the foreheadof the morning: what I think I utter, and spend mymalice in my breath. Meeting two such wealsmen asyou are--I cannot call you Lycurguses--if the drinkyou give me touch my palate adversely, I make acrooked face at it. I can't say your worships havedelivered the matter well, when I find the ass incompound with the major part of your syllables: andthough I must be content to bear with those that sayyou are reverend grave men, yet they lie deadly thattell you you have good faces. If you see this inthe map of my microcosm, follows it that I am knownwell enough too? what barm can your bissonconspectuities glean out of this character, if I beknown well enough too?

BRUTUS

Come, sir, come, we know you well enough.

MENENIUS

You know neither me, yourselves nor any thing. Youare ambitious for poor knaves' caps and legs: youwear out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing acause between an orange wife and a fosset-seller;and then rejourn the controversy of three pence to asecond day of audience. When you are hearing amatter between party and party, if you chance to bepinched with the colic, you make faces likemummers; set up the bloody flag against allpatience; and, in roaring for a chamber-pot,dismiss the controversy bleeding the more entangledby your hearing: all the peace you make in theircause is, calling both the parties knaves. You area pair of strange ones.

BRUTUS

Come, come, you are well understood to be aperfecter giber for the table than a necessarybencher in the Capitol.

MENENIUS

Our very priests must become mockers, if they shallencounter such ridiculous subjects as you are. Whenyou speak best unto the purpose, it is not worth thewagging of your beards; and your beards deserve notso honourable a grave as to stuff a botcher'scushion, or to be entombed in an ass's pack-saddle. Yet you must be saying, Marcius is proud;who in a cheap estimation, is worth predecessorssince Deucalion, though peradventure some of thebest of 'em were hereditary hangmen. God-den toyour worships: more of your conversation wouldinfect my brain, being the herdsmen of the beastlyplebeians: I will be bold to take my leave of you.BRUTUS and SICINIUS go aside
Enter VOLUMNIA, VIRGILIA, and VALERIA
How now, my as fair as noble ladies,--and the moon,were she earthly, no nobler,--whither do you followyour eyes so fast?

VOLUMNIA

Honourable Menenius, my boy Marcius approaches; forthe love of Juno, let's go.

MENENIUS

Ha! Marcius coming home!

VOLUMNIA

Ay, worthy Menenius; and with most prosperousapprobation.

MENENIUS

Take my cap, Jupiter, and I thank thee. Hoo!Marcius coming home!

VOLUMNIA

VIRGILIA

Nay,'tis true.

VOLUMNIA

Look, here's a letter from him: the state hathanother, his wife another; and, I think, there's oneat home for you.

MENENIUS

I will make my very house reel tonight: a letter forme!

VIRGILIA

Yes, certain, there's a letter for you; I saw't.

MENENIUS

A letter for me! it gives me an estate of sevenyears' health; in which time I will make a lip atthe physician: the most sovereign prescription inGalen is but empiricutic, and, to this preservative,of no better report than a horse-drench. Is henot wounded? he was wont to come home wounded.

VIRGILIA

O, no, no, no.

VOLUMNIA

O, he is wounded; I thank the gods for't.

MENENIUS

So do I too, if it be not too much: brings a'victory in his pocket? the wounds become him.

VOLUMNIA

On's brows: Menenius, he comes the third time homewith the oaken garland.

MENENIUS

Has he disciplined Aufidius soundly?

VOLUMNIA

Titus Lartius writes, they fought together, butAufidius got off.

MENENIUS

And 'twas time for him too, I'll warrant him that:an he had stayed by him, I would not have been sofidiused for all the chests in Corioli, and the goldthat's in them. Is the senate possessed of this?

VOLUMNIA

Good ladies, let's go. Yes, yes, yes; the senatehas letters from the general, wherein he gives myson the whole name of the war: he hath in thisaction outdone his former deeds doubly

VALERIA

In troth, there's wondrous things spoke of him.

MENENIUS

Wondrous! ay, I warrant you, and not without histrue purchasing.

VIRGILIA

The gods grant them true!

VOLUMNIA

True! pow, wow.

MENENIUS

True! I'll be sworn they are true.Where is he wounded?To the Tribunes
God save your good worships! Marcius is cominghome: he has more cause to be proud. Where is he wounded?

VOLUMNIA

I' the shoulder and i' the left arm there will belarge cicatrices to show the people, when he shallstand for his place. He received in the repulse ofTarquin seven hurts i' the body.

MENENIUS

One i' the neck, and two i' the thigh,--there'snine that I know.

VOLUMNIA

He had, before this last expedition, twenty-fivewounds upon him.

MENENIUS

Now it's twenty-seven: every gash was an enemy's grave.A shout and flourish
Hark! the trumpets.

VOLUMNIA

These are the ushers of Marcius: before him hecarries noise, and behind him he leaves tears:Death, that dark spirit, in 's nervy arm doth lie;Which, being advanced, declines, and then men die.A sennet. Trumpets sound. Enter COMINIUS the  general, and TITUS LARTIUS; between them, CORIOLANUS,  crowned with an oaken garland; with Captains and Soldiers, and a Herald


Herald

Know, Rome, that all alone Marcius did fightWithin Corioli gates: where he hath won,With fame, a name to Caius Marcius; theseIn honour follows Coriolanus.Welcome to Rome, renowned Coriolanus!Flourish


All

Welcome to Rome, renowned Coriolanus!

CORIOLANUS

No more of this; it does offend my heart:Pray now, no more.

COMINIUS

                  Look, sir, your mother!

CORIOLANUS

O,You have, I know, petition'd all the godsFor my prosperity!Kneels


VOLUMNIA

                  Nay, my good soldier, up;My gentle Marcius, worthy Caius, andBy deed-achieving honour newly named,--What is it?--Coriolanus must I call thee?--But O, thy wife!

CORIOLANUS

                  My gracious silence, hail!Wouldst thou have laugh'd had I come coffin'd home,That weep'st to see me triumph? Ay, my dear,Such eyes the widows in Corioli wear,And mothers that lack sons.

MENENIUS

Now, the gods crown thee!

CORIOLANUS

And live you yet?To VALERIA
O my sweet lady, pardon.

VOLUMNIA

I know not where to turn: O, welcome home:And welcome, general: and ye're welcome all.

MENENIUS

A hundred thousand welcomes. I could weepAnd I could laugh, I am light and heavy. Welcome.A curse begin at very root on's heart,That is not glad to see thee! You are threeThat Rome should dote on: yet, by the faith of men,We have some old crab-trees hereat home that will notBe grafted to your relish. Yet welcome, warriors:We call a nettle but a nettle andThe faults of fools but folly.

COMINIUS

Ever right.

CORIOLANUS

Menenius ever, ever.

Herald

Give way there, and go on!

CORIOLANUS

[To VOLUMNIA and VIRGILIA]  Your hand, and yours:Ere in our own house I do shade my head,The good patricians must be visited;From whom I have received not only greetings,But with them change of honours.

VOLUMNIA

I have livedTo see inherited my very wishesAnd the buildings of my fancy: onlyThere's one thing wanting, which I doubt not butOur Rome will cast upon thee.

CORIOLANUS

Know, good mother,I had rather be their servant in my way,Than sway with them in theirs.

COMINIUS

On, to the Capitol!Flourish. Cornets. Exeunt in state, as before. BRUTUS and SICINIUS come forward


BRUTUS

All tongues speak of him, and the bleared sightsAre spectacled to see him: your prattling nurseInto a rapture lets her baby cryWhile she chats him: the kitchen malkin pinsHer richest lockram 'bout her reechy neck,Clambering the walls to eye him: stalls, bulks, windows,Are smother'd up, leads fill'd, and ridges horsedWith variable complexions, all agreeingIn earnestness to see him: seld-shown flamensDo press among the popular throngs and puffTo win a vulgar station: or veil'd damesCommit the war of white and damask inTheir nicely-gawded cheeks to the wanton spoilOf Phoebus' burning kisses: such a potherAs if that whatsoever god who leads himWere slily crept into his human powersAnd gave him graceful posture.

SICINIUS

On the sudden,I warrant him consul.

BRUTUS

Then our office may,During his power, go sleep.

SICINIUS

He cannot temperately transport his honoursFrom where he should begin and end, but willLose those he hath won.

BRUTUS

In that there's comfort.

SICINIUS

Doubt notThe commoners, for whom we stand, but theyUpon their ancient malice will forgetWith the least cause these his new honours, whichThat he will give them make I as little questionAs he is proud to do't.

BRUTUS

I heard him swear,Were he to stand for consul, never would heAppear i' the market-place nor on him putThe napless vesture of humility;Nor showing, as the manner is, his woundsTo the people, beg their stinking breaths.

SICINIUS

'Tis right.

BRUTUS

It was his word: O, he would miss it ratherThan carry it but by the suit of the gentry to him,And the desire of the nobles.

SICINIUS

I wish no betterThan have him hold that purpose and to put itIn execution.

BRUTUS

'Tis most like he will.

SICINIUS

It shall be to him then as our good wills,A sure destruction.

BRUTUS

So it must fall outTo him or our authorities. For an end,We must suggest the people in what hatredHe still hath held them; that to's power he wouldHave made them mules, silenced their pleaders andDispropertied their freedoms, holding them,In human action and capacity,Of no more soul nor fitness for the worldThan camels in the war, who have their provandOnly for bearing burdens, and sore blowsFor sinking under them.

SICINIUS

This, as you say, suggestedAt some time when his soaring insolenceShall touch the people--which time shall not want,If he be put upon 't; and that's as easyAs to set dogs on sheep--will be his fireTo kindle their dry stubble; and their blazeShall darken him for ever.Enter a Messenger


BRUTUS

What's the matter?

Messenger

You are sent for to the Capitol. 'Tis thoughtThat Marcius shall be consul:I have seen the dumb men throng to see him andThe blind to bear him speak: matrons flung gloves,Ladies and maids their scarfs and handkerchers,Upon him as he pass'd: the nobles bended,As to Jove's statue, and the commons madeA shower and thunder with their caps and shouts:I never saw the like.

BRUTUS

Let's to the Capitol;And carry with us ears and eyes for the time,But hearts for the event.

SICINIUS

Have with you.Exeunt

SCENE II. The same. The Capitol.

Enter two Officers, to lay cushions


First Officer

Come, come, they are almost here. How many standfor consulships?

Second Officer

Three, they say: but 'tis thought of every oneCoriolanus will carry it.

First Officer

That's a brave fellow; but he's vengeance proud, andloves not the common people.

Second Officer

Faith, there had been many great men that haveflattered the people, who ne'er loved them; and therebe many that they have loved, they know notwherefore: so that, if they love they know not why,they hate upon no better a ground: therefore, forCoriolanus neither to care whether they love or hatehim manifests the true knowledge he has in theirdisposition; and out of his noble carelessness letsthem plainly see't.

First Officer

If he did not care whether he had their love or no,he waved indifferently 'twixt doing them neithergood nor harm: but he seeks their hate with greaterdevotion than can render it him; and leavesnothing undone that may fully discover him theiropposite. Now, to seem to affect the malice anddispleasure of the people is as bad as that which hedislikes, to flatter them for their love.

Second Officer

He hath deserved worthily of his country: and hisascent is not by such easy degrees as those who,having been supple and courteous to the people,bonneted, without any further deed to have them atan into their estimation and report: but he hath soplanted his honours in their eyes, and his actionsin their hearts, that for their tongues to besilent, and not confess so much, were a kind ofingrateful injury; to report otherwise, were amalice, that, giving itself the lie, would pluckreproof and rebuke from every ear that heard it.

First Officer

No more of him; he is a worthy man: make way, theyare coming.A sennet. Enter, with actors before them, COMINIUS  the consul, MENENIUS, CORIOLANUS, Senators,  SICINIUS and BRUTUS. The Senators take their  places; the Tribunes take their Places by themselves. CORIOLANUS stands


MENENIUS

Having determined of the Volsces andTo send for Titus Lartius, it remains,As the main point of this our after-meeting,To gratify his noble service thatHath thus stood for his country: therefore,please you,Most reverend and grave elders, to desireThe present consul, and last generalIn our well-found successes, to reportA little of that worthy work perform'dBy Caius Marcius Coriolanus, whomWe met here both to thank and to rememberWith honours like himself.

First Senator

Speak, good Cominius:Leave nothing out for length, and make us thinkRather our state's defective for requitalThan we to stretch it out.To the Tribunes
Masters o' the people,We do request your kindest ears, and after,Your loving motion toward the common body,To yield what passes here.

SICINIUS

We are conventedUpon a pleasing treaty, and have heartsInclinable to honour and advanceThe theme of our assembly.

BRUTUS

Which the ratherWe shall be blest to do, if he rememberA kinder value of the people thanHe hath hereto prized them at.

MENENIUS

That's off, that's off;I would you rather had been silent. Please youTo hear Cominius speak?

BRUTUS

Most willingly;But yet my caution was more pertinentThan the rebuke you give it.

MENENIUS

He loves your peopleBut tie him not to be their bedfellow.Worthy Cominius, speak.CORIOLANUS offers to go away
Nay, keep your place.

First Senator

Sit, Coriolanus; never shame to hearWhat you have nobly done.

CORIOLANUS

Your horror's pardon:I had rather have my wounds to heal againThan hear say how I got them.

BRUTUS

Sir, I hopeMy words disbench'd you not.

CORIOLANUS

No, sir: yet oft,When blows have made me stay, I fled from words.You soothed not, therefore hurt not: butyour people,I love them as they weigh.

MENENIUS

Pray now, sit down.

CORIOLANUS

I had rather have one scratch my head i' the sunWhen the alarum were struck than idly sitTo hear my nothings monster'd.Exit


MENENIUS

Masters of the people,Your multiplying spawn how can he flatter--That's thousand to one good one--when you now seeHe had rather venture all his limbs for honourThan one on's ears to hear it? Proceed, Cominius.

COMINIUS

I shall lack voice: the deeds of CoriolanusShould not be utter'd feebly. It is heldThat valour is the chiefest virtue, andMost dignifies the haver: if it be,The man I speak of cannot in the worldBe singly counterpoised. At sixteen years,When Tarquin made a head for Rome, he foughtBeyond the mark of others: our then dictator,Whom with all praise I point at, saw him fight,When with his Amazonian chin he droveThe bristled lips before him: be bestridAn o'er-press'd Roman and i' the consul's viewSlew three opposers: Tarquin's self he met,And struck him on his knee: in that day's feats,When he might act the woman in the scene,He proved best man i' the field, and for his meedWas brow-bound with the oak. His pupil ageMan-enter'd thus, he waxed like a sea,And in the brunt of seventeen battles sinceHe lurch'd all swords of the garland. For this last,Before and in Corioli, let me say,I cannot speak him home: he stopp'd the fliers;And by his rare example made the cowardTurn terror into sport: as weeds beforeA vessel under sail, so men obey'dAnd fell below his stem: his sword, death's stamp,Where it did mark, it took; from face to footHe was a thing of blood, whose every motionWas timed with dying cries: alone he enter'dThe mortal gate of the city, which he paintedWith shunless destiny; aidless came off,And with a sudden reinforcement struckCorioli like a planet: now all's his:When, by and by, the din of war gan pierceHis ready sense; then straight his doubled spiritRe-quicken'd what in flesh was fatigate,And to the battle came he; where he didRun reeking o'er the lives of men, as if'Twere a perpetual spoil: and till we call'dBoth field and city ours, he never stoodTo ease his breast with panting.

MENENIUS

Worthy man!

First Senator

He cannot but with measure fit the honoursWhich we devise him.

COMINIUS

Our spoils he kick'd at,And look'd upon things precious as they wereThe common muck of the world: he covets lessThan misery itself would give; rewardsHis deeds with doing them, and is contentTo spend the time to end it.

MENENIUS

He's right noble:Let him be call'd for.

First Senator

Call Coriolanus.

Officer

He doth appear.Re-enter CORIOLANUS


MENENIUS

The senate, Coriolanus, are well pleasedTo make thee consul.

CORIOLANUS

I do owe them stillMy life and services.

MENENIUS

It then remainsThat you do speak to the people.

CORIOLANUS

I do beseech you,Let me o'erleap that custom, for I cannotPut on the gown, stand naked and entreat them,For my wounds' sake, to give their suffrage: please youThat I may pass this doing.

SICINIUS

Sir, the peopleMust have their voices; neither will they bateOne jot of ceremony.

MENENIUS

Put them not to't:Pray you, go fit you to the custom andTake to you, as your predecessors have,Your honour with your form.

CORIOLANUS

It is apartThat I shall blush in acting, and might wellBe taken from the people.

BRUTUS

Mark you that?

CORIOLANUS

To brag unto them, thus I did, and thus;Show them the unaching scars which I should hide,As if I had received them for the hireOf their breath only!

MENENIUS

Do not stand upon't.We recommend to you, tribunes of the people,Our purpose to them: and to our noble consulWish we all joy and honour.

Senators

To Coriolanus come all joy and honour!Flourish of cornets. Exeunt all but SICINIUS and BRUTUS


BRUTUS

You see how he intends to use the people.

SICINIUS

May they perceive's intent! He will require them,As if he did contemn what he requestedShould be in them to give.

BRUTUS

Come, we'll inform themOf our proceedings here: on the marketplace,I know, they do attend us.Exeunt

SCENE III. The same. The Forum.

Enter seven or eight Citizens


First Citizen

Once, if he do require our voices, we ought not to deny him.

Second Citizen

We may, sir, if we will.

Third Citizen

We have power in ourselves to do it, but it is apower that we have no power to do; for if he show ushis wounds and tell us his deeds, we are to put ourtongues into those wounds and speak for them; so, ifhe tell us his noble deeds, we must also tell himour noble acceptance of them. Ingratitude ismonstrous, and for the multitude to be ingrateful,were to make a monster of the multitude: of thewhich we being members, should bring ourselves to bemonstrous members.

First Citizen

And to make us no better thought of, a little helpwill serve; for once we stood up about the corn, hehimself stuck not to call us the many-headed multitude.

Third Citizen

We have been called so of many; not that our headsare some brown, some black, some auburn, some bald,but that our wits are so diversely coloured: andtruly I think if all our wits were to issue out ofone skull, they would fly east, west, north, south,and their consent of one direct way should be atonce to all the points o' the compass.

Second Citizen

Think you so? Which way do you judge my wit wouldfly?

Third Citizen

Nay, your wit will not so soon out as another man'swill;'tis strongly wedged up in a block-head, butif it were at liberty, 'twould, sure, southward.

Second Citizen

Why that way?

Third Citizen

To lose itself in a fog, where being three partsmelted away with rotten dews, the fourth would returnfor conscience sake, to help to get thee a wife.

Second Citizen

You are never without your tricks: you may, you may.

Third Citizen

Are you all resolved to give your voices? Butthat's no matter, the greater part carries it. Isay, if he would incline to the people, there wasnever a worthier man.Enter CORIOLANUS in a gown of humility, with MENENIUS
Here he comes, and in the gown of humility: mark hisbehavior. We are not to stay all together, but tocome by him where he stands, by ones, by twos, andby threes. He's to make his requests byparticulars; wherein every one of us has a singlehonour, in giving him our own voices with our owntongues: therefore follow me, and I direct you howyou shall go by him.

All

Content, content.Exeunt Citizens


MENENIUS

O sir, you are not right: have you not knownThe worthiest men have done't?

CORIOLANUS

What must I say?'I Pray, sir'--Plague upon't! I cannot bringMy tongue to such a pace:--'Look, sir, my wounds!I got them in my country's service, whenSome certain of your brethren roar'd and ranFrom the noise of our own drums.'

MENENIUS

O me, the gods!You must not speak of that: you must desire themTo think upon you.

CORIOLANUS

                  Think upon me! hang 'em!I would they would forget me, like the virtuesWhich our divines lose by 'em.

MENENIUS

You'll mar all:I'll leave you: pray you, speak to 'em, I pray you,In wholesome manner.Exit


CORIOLANUS

Bid them wash their facesAnd keep their teeth clean.Re-enter two of the Citizens
So, here comes a brace.Re-enter a third Citizen
You know the cause, air, of my standing here.

Third Citizen

We do, sir; tell us what hath brought you to't.

CORIOLANUS

Mine own desert.

Second Citizen

Your own desert!

CORIOLANUS

Ay, but not mine own desire.

Third Citizen

How not your own desire?

CORIOLANUS

No, sir,'twas never my desire yet to trouble thepoor with begging.

Third Citizen

You must think, if we give you any thing, we hope togain by you.

CORIOLANUS

Well then, I pray, your price o' the consulship?

First Citizen

The price is to ask it kindly.

CORIOLANUS

Kindly! Sir, I pray, let me ha't: I have wounds toshow you, which shall be yours in private. Yourgood voice, sir; what say you?

Second Citizen

You shall ha' it, worthy sir.

CORIOLANUS

A match, sir. There's in all two worthy voicesbegged. I have your alms: adieu.

Third Citizen

But this is something odd.

Second Citizen

An 'twere to give again,--but 'tis no matter.Exeunt the three Citizens
Re-enter two other Citizens


CORIOLANUS

Pray you now, if it may stand with the tune of yourvoices that I may be consul, I have here thecustomary gown.

Fourth Citizen

You have deserved nobly of your country, and youhave not deserved nobly.

CORIOLANUS

Your enigma?

Fourth Citizen

You have been a scourge to her enemies, you havebeen a rod to her friends; you have not indeed lovedthe common people.

CORIOLANUS

You should account me the more virtuous that I havenot been common in my love. I will, sir, flatter mysworn brother, the people, to earn a dearerestimation of them; 'tis a condition they accountgentle: and since the wisdom of their choice israther to have my hat than my heart, I will practisethe insinuating nod and be off to them mostcounterfeitly; that is, sir, I will counterfeit thebewitchment of some popular man and give itbountiful to the desirers. Therefore, beseech you,I may be consul.

Fifth Citizen

We hope to find you our friend; and therefore giveyou our voices heartily.

Fourth Citizen

You have received many wounds for your country.

CORIOLANUS

I will not seal your knowledge with showing them. Iwill make much of your voices, and so trouble you no further.

Both Citizens

The gods give you joy, sir, heartily!Exeunt


CORIOLANUS

Most sweet voices!Better it is to die, better to starve,Than crave the hire which first we do deserve.Why in this woolvish toge should I stand here,To beg of Hob and Dick, that do appear,Their needless vouches? Custom calls me to't:What custom wills, in all things should we do't,The dust on antique time would lie unswept,And mountainous error be too highly heaptFor truth to o'er-peer. Rather than fool it so,Let the high office and the honour goTo one that would do thus. I am half through;The one part suffer'd, the other will I do.Re-enter three Citizens more
Here come more voices.Your voices: for your voices I have fought;Watch'd for your voices; for Your voices bearOf wounds two dozen odd; battles thrice sixI have seen and heard of; for your voices haveDone many things, some less, some more your voices:Indeed I would be consul.

Sixth Citizen

He has done nobly, and cannot go without any honestman's voice.

Seventh Citizen

Therefore let him be consul: the gods give him joy,and make him good friend to the people!

All Citizens

Amen, amen. God save thee, noble consul!Exeunt


CORIOLANUS

Worthy voices!Re-enter MENENIUS, with BRUTUS and SICINIUS


MENENIUS

You have stood your limitation; and the tribunesEndue you with the people's voice: remainsThat, in the official marks invested, youAnon do meet the senate.

CORIOLANUS

Is this done?

SICINIUS

The custom of request you have discharged:The people do admit you, and are summon'dTo meet anon, upon your approbation.

CORIOLANUS

Where? at the senate-house?

SICINIUS

There, Coriolanus.

CORIOLANUS

May I change these garments?

SICINIUS

You may, sir.

CORIOLANUS

That I'll straight do; and, knowing myself again,Repair to the senate-house.

MENENIUS

I'll keep you company. Will you along?

BRUTUS

We stay here for the people.

SICINIUS

Fare you well.Exeunt CORIOLANUS and MENENIUS
He has it now, and by his looks methink'Tis warm at 's heart.

BRUTUS

With a proud heart he wore his humble weeds.will you dismiss the people?Re-enter Citizens


SICINIUS

How now, my masters! have you chose this man?

First Citizen

He has our voices, sir.

BRUTUS

We pray the gods he may deserve your loves.

Second Citizen

Amen, sir: to my poor unworthy notice,He mock'd us when he begg'd our voices.

Third Citizen

CertainlyHe flouted us downright.

First Citizen

No,'tis his kind of speech: he did not mock us.

Second Citizen

Not one amongst us, save yourself, but saysHe used us scornfully: he should have show'd usHis marks of merit, wounds received for's country.

SICINIUS

Why, so he did, I am sure.

Citizens

No, no; no man saw 'em.

Third Citizen

He said he had wounds, which he could showin private;And with his hat, thus waving it in scorn,'I would be consul,' says he: 'aged custom,But by your voices, will not so permit me;Your voices therefore.' When we granted that,Here was 'I thank you for your voices: thank you:Your most sweet voices: now you have leftyour voices,I have no further with you.' Was not this mockery?

SICINIUS

Why either were you ignorant to see't,Or, seeing it, of such childish friendlinessTo yield your voices?

BRUTUS

Could you not have told himAs you were lesson'd, when he had no power,But was a petty servant to the state,He was your enemy, ever spake againstYour liberties and the charters that you bearI' the body of the weal; and now, arrivingA place of potency and sway o' the state,If he should still malignantly remainFast foe to the plebeii, your voices mightBe curses to yourselves? You should have saidThat as his worthy deeds did claim no lessThan what he stood for, so his gracious natureWould think upon you for your voices andTranslate his malice towards you into love,Standing your friendly lord.

SICINIUS

Thus to have said,As you were fore-advised, had touch'd his spiritAnd tried his inclination; from him pluck'dEither his gracious promise, which you might,As cause had call'd you up, have held him toOr else it would have gall'd his surly nature,Which easily endures not articleTying him to aught; so putting him to rage,You should have ta'en the advantage of his cholerAnd pass'd him unelected.

BRUTUS

Did you perceiveHe did solicit you in free contemptWhen he did need your loves, and do you thinkThat his contempt shall not be bruising to you,When he hath power to crush? Why, had your bodiesNo heart among you? or had you tongues to cryAgainst the rectorship of judgment?

SICINIUS

Have youEre now denied the asker? and now againOf him that did not ask, but mock, bestowYour sued-for tongues?

Third Citizen

He's not confirm'd; we may deny him yet.

Second Citizen

And will deny him:I'll have five hundred voices of that sound.

First Citizen

I twice five hundred and their friends to piece 'em.

BRUTUS

Get you hence instantly, and tell those friends,They have chose a consul that will from them takeTheir liberties; make them of no more voiceThan dogs that are as often beat for barkingAs therefore kept to do so.

SICINIUS

Let them assemble,And on a safer judgment all revokeYour ignorant election; enforce his pride,And his old hate unto you; besides, forget notWith what contempt he wore the humble weed,How in his suit he scorn'd you; but your loves,Thinking upon his services, took from youThe apprehension of his present portance,Which most gibingly, ungravely, he did fashionAfter the inveterate hate he bears you.

BRUTUS

LayA fault on us, your tribunes; that we laboured,No impediment between, but that you mustCast your election on him.

SICINIUS

Say, you chose himMore after our commandment than as guidedBy your own true affections, and that your minds,Preoccupied with what you rather must doThan what you should, made you against the grainTo voice him consul: lay the fault on us.

BRUTUS

Ay, spare us not. Say we read lectures to you.How youngly he began to serve his country,How long continued, and what stock he springs of,The noble house o' the Marcians, from whence cameThat Ancus Marcius, Numa's daughter's son,Who, after great Hostilius, here was king;Of the same house Publius and Quintus were,That our beat water brought by conduits hither;And  [Censorinus,]  nobly named so,Twice being  [by the people chosen]  censor,Was his great ancestor.

SICINIUS

One thus descended,That hath beside well in his person wroughtTo be set high in place, we did commendTo your remembrances: but you have found,Scaling his present bearing with his past,That he's your fixed enemy, and revokeYour sudden approbation.

BRUTUS

Say, you ne'er had done't--Harp on that still--but by our putting on;And presently, when you have drawn your number,Repair to the Capitol.

All

We will so: almost allRepent in their election.Exeunt Citizens


BRUTUS

Let them go on;This mutiny were better put in hazard,Than stay, past doubt, for greater:If, as his nature is, he fall in rageWith their refusal, both observe and answerThe vantage of his anger.

SICINIUS

To the Capitol, come:We will be there before the stream o' the people;And this shall seem, as partly 'tis, their own,Which we have goaded onward.Exeunt

ACT III
SCENE I. Rome. A street.

Cornets. Enter CORIOLANUS, MENENIUS, all the Gentry, COMINIUS, TITUS LARTIUS, and other Senators


CORIOLANUS

Tullus Aufidius then had made new head?

LARTIUS

He had, my lord; and that it was which causedOur swifter composition.

CORIOLANUS

So then the Volsces stand but as at first,Ready, when time shall prompt them, to make road.Upon's again.

COMINIUS

They are worn, lord consul, so,That we shall hardly in our ages seeTheir banners wave again.

CORIOLANUS

Saw you Aufidius?

LARTIUS

On safe-guard he  came to me; and did curseAgainst the Volsces, for they had so vilelyYielded the town: he is retired to Antium.

CORIOLANUS

Spoke he of me?

LARTIUS

                  He did, my lord.

CORIOLANUS

How? what?

LARTIUS

How often he had met you, sword to sword;That of all things upon the earth he hatedYour person most, that he would pawn his fortunesTo hopeless restitution, so he mightBe call'd your vanquisher.

CORIOLANUS

At Antium lives he?

LARTIUS

At Antium.

CORIOLANUS

I wish I had a cause to seek him there,To oppose his hatred fully. Welcome home.Enter SICINIUS and BRUTUS
Behold, these are the tribunes of the people,The tongues o' the common mouth: I do despise them;For they do prank them in authority,Against all noble sufferance.

SICINIUS

Pass no further.

CORIOLANUS

Ha! what is that?

BRUTUS

It will be dangerous to go on: no further.

CORIOLANUS

What makes this change?

MENENIUS

The matter?

COMINIUS

Hath he not pass'd the noble and the common?

BRUTUS

Cominius, no.

CORIOLANUS

                  Have I had children's voices?

First Senator

Tribunes, give way; he shall to the market-place.

BRUTUS

The people are incensed against him.

SICINIUS

Stop,Or all will fall in broil.

CORIOLANUS

Are these your herd?Must these have voices, that can yield them nowAnd straight disclaim their tongues? What areyour offices?You being their mouths, why rule you not their teeth?Have you not set them on?

MENENIUS

Be calm, be calm.

CORIOLANUS

It is a purposed thing, and grows by plot,To curb the will of the nobility:Suffer't, and live with such as cannot ruleNor ever will be ruled.

BRUTUS

Call't not a plot:The people cry you mock'd them, and of late,When corn was given them gratis, you repined;Scandal'd the suppliants for the people, call'd themTime-pleasers, flatterers, foes to nobleness.

CORIOLANUS

Why, this was known before.

BRUTUS

Not to them all.

CORIOLANUS

Have you inform'd them sithence?

BRUTUS

How! I inform them!

CORIOLANUS

You are like to do such business.

BRUTUS

Not unlike,Each way, to better yours.

CORIOLANUS

Why then should I be consul? By yond clouds,Let me deserve so ill as you, and make meYour fellow tribune.

SICINIUS

You show too much of thatFor which the people stir: if you will passTo where you are bound, you must inquire your way,Which you are out of, with a gentler spirit,Or never be so noble as a consul,Nor yoke with him for tribune.

MENENIUS

Let's be calm.

COMINIUS

The people are abused; set on. This palteringBecomes not Rome, nor has CoriolanusDeserved this so dishonour'd rub, laid falselyI' the plain way of his merit.

CORIOLANUS

Tell me of corn!This was my speech, and I will speak't again--

MENENIUS

Not now, not now.

First Senator

                  Not in this heat, sir, now.

CORIOLANUS

Now, as I live, I will. My nobler friends,I crave their pardons:For the mutable, rank-scented many, let themRegard me as I do not flatter, andTherein behold themselves: I say again,In soothing them, we nourish 'gainst our senateThe cockle of rebellion, insolence, sedition,Which we ourselves have plough'd for, sow'd,and scatter'd,By mingling them with us, the honour'd number,Who lack not virtue, no, nor power, but thatWhich they have given to beggars.

MENENIUS

Well, no more.

First Senator

No more words, we beseech you.

CORIOLANUS

How! no more!As for my country I have shed my blood,Not fearing outward force, so shall my lungsCoin words till their decay against those measles,Which we disdain should tatter us, yet soughtThe very way to catch them.

BRUTUS

You speak o' the people,As if you were a god to punish, notA man of their infirmity.

SICINIUS

'Twere wellWe let the people know't.

MENENIUS

What, what? his choler?

CORIOLANUS

Choler!Were I as patient as the midnight sleep,By Jove, 'twould be my mind!

SICINIUS

It is a mindThat shall remain a poison where it is,Not poison any further.

CORIOLANUS

Shall remain!Hear you this Triton of the minnows? mark youHis absolute 'shall'?

COMINIUS

'Twas from the canon.

CORIOLANUS

'Shall'!O good but most unwise patricians! why,You grave but reckless senators, have you thusGiven Hydra here to choose an officer,That with his peremptory 'shall,' being butThe horn and noise o' the monster's, wants not spiritTo say he'll turn your current in a ditch,And make your channel his? If he have powerThen vail your ignorance; if none, awakeYour dangerous lenity. If you are learn'd,Be not as common fools; if you are not,Let them have cushions by you. You are plebeians,If they be senators: and they are no less,When, both your voices blended, the great'st tasteMost palates theirs. They choose their magistrate,And such a one as he, who puts his 'shall,'His popular 'shall' against a graver benchThan ever frown in Greece. By Jove himself!It makes the consuls base: and my soul achesTo know, when two authorities are up,Neither supreme, how soon confusionMay enter 'twixt the gap of both and takeThe one by the other.

COMINIUS

Well, on to the market-place.

CORIOLANUS

Whoever gave that counsel, to give forthThe corn o' the storehouse gratis, as 'twas usedSometime in Greece,--

MENENIUS

Well, well, no more of that.

CORIOLANUS

Though there the people had more absolute power,I say, they nourish'd disobedience, fedThe ruin of the state.

BRUTUS

Why, shall the people giveOne that speaks thus their voice?

CORIOLANUS

I'll give my reasons,More worthier than their voices. They know the cornWas not our recompense, resting well assuredThat ne'er did service for't: being press'd to the war,Even when the navel of the state was touch'd,They would not thread the gates. This kind of serviceDid not deserve corn gratis. Being i' the warTheir mutinies and revolts, wherein they show'dMost valour, spoke not for them: the accusationWhich they have often made against the senate,All cause unborn, could never be the motiveOf our so frank donation. Well, what then?How shall this bisson multitude digestThe senate's courtesy? Let deeds expressWhat's like to be their words: 'we did request it;We are the greater poll, and in true fearThey gave us our demands.' Thus we debaseThe nature of our seats and make the rabbleCall our cares fears; which will in timeBreak ope the locks o' the senate and bring inThe crows to peck the eagles.

MENENIUS

Come, enough.

BRUTUS

Enough, with over-measure.

CORIOLANUS

No, take more:What may be sworn by, both divine and human,Seal what I end withal! This double worship,Where one part does disdain with cause, the otherInsult without all reason, where gentry, title, wisdom,Cannot conclude but by the yea and noOf general ignorance,--it must omitReal necessities, and give way the whileTo unstable slightness: purpose so barr'd,it follows,Nothing is done to purpose. Therefore, beseech you,--You that will be less fearful than discreet,That love the fundamental part of stateMore than you doubt the change on't, that preferA noble life before a long, and wishTo jump a body with a dangerous physicThat's sure of death without it, at once pluck outThe multitudinous tongue; let them not lickThe sweet which is their poison: your dishonourMangles true judgment and bereaves the stateOf that integrity which should become't,Not having the power to do the good it would,For the in which doth control't.

BRUTUS

Has said enough.

SICINIUS

Has spoken like a traitor, and shall answerAs traitors do.

CORIOLANUS

                  Thou wretch, despite o'erwhelm thee!What should the people do with these bald tribunes?On whom depending, their obedience failsTo the greater bench: in a rebellion,When what's not meet, but what must be, was law,Then were they chosen: in a better hour,Let what is meet be said it must be meet,And throw their power i' the dust.

BRUTUS

Manifest treason!

SICINIUS

                  This a consul? no.

BRUTUS

The aediles, ho!Enter an AEdile
Let him be apprehended.

SICINIUS

Go, call the people:Exit AEdile
in whose name myselfAttach thee as a traitorous innovator,A foe to the public weal: obey, I charge thee,And follow to thine answer.

CORIOLANUS

Hence, old goat!Senators,  & C	We'll surety him.

COMINIUS

                  Aged sir, hands off.

CORIOLANUS

Hence, rotten thing! or I shall shake thy bonesOut of thy garments.

SICINIUS

Help, ye citizens!Enter a rabble of Citizens (Plebeians), with the AEdiles


MENENIUS

On both sides more respect.

SICINIUS

Here's he that would take from you all your power.

BRUTUS

Seize him, AEdiles!

Citizens

Down with him! down with him!Senators,  & C	Weapons, weapons, weapons!They all bustle about CORIOLANUS, crying
'Tribunes!' 'Patricians!' 'Citizens!' 'What, ho!''Sicinius!' 'Brutus!' 'Coriolanus!' 'Citizens!''Peace, peace, peace!' 'Stay, hold, peace!'

MENENIUS

What is about to be? I am out of breath;Confusion's near; I cannot speak. You, tribunesTo the people! Coriolanus, patience!Speak, good Sicinius.

SICINIUS

Hear me, people; peace!

Citizens

Let's hear our tribune: peace Speak, speak, speak.

SICINIUS

You are at point to lose your liberties:Marcius would have all from you; Marcius,Whom late you have named for consul.

MENENIUS

Fie, fie, fie!This is the way to kindle, not to quench.

First Senator

To unbuild the city and to lay all flat.

SICINIUS

What is the city but the people?

Citizens

True,The people are the city.

BRUTUS

By the consent of all, we were establish'dThe people's magistrates.

Citizens

You so remain.

MENENIUS

And so are like to do.

COMINIUS

That is the way to lay the city flat;To bring the roof to the foundation,And bury all, which yet distinctly ranges,In heaps and piles of ruin.

SICINIUS

This deserves death.

BRUTUS

Or let us stand to our authority,Or let us lose it. We do here pronounce,Upon the part o' the people, in whose powerWe were elected theirs, Marcius is worthyOf present death.

SICINIUS

                  Therefore lay hold of him;Bear him to the rock Tarpeian, and from thenceInto destruction cast him.

BRUTUS

AEdiles, seize him!

Citizens

Yield, Marcius, yield!

MENENIUS

Hear me one word;Beseech you, tribunes, hear me but a word.

AEdile

Peace, peace!

MENENIUS

[To BRUTUS]  Be that you seem, truly yourcountry's friend,And temperately proceed to what you wouldThus violently redress.

BRUTUS

Sir, those cold ways,That seem like prudent helps, are very poisonousWhere the disease is violent. Lay hands upon him,And bear him to the rock.

CORIOLANUS

No, I'll die here.Drawing his sword
There's some among you have beheld me fighting:Come, try upon yourselves what you have seen me.

MENENIUS

Down with that sword! Tribunes, withdraw awhile.

BRUTUS

Lay hands upon him.

COMINIUS

Help Marcius, help,You that be noble; help him, young and old!

Citizens

Down with him, down with him!In this mutiny, the Tribunes, the AEdiles, and the People, are beat in


MENENIUS

Go, get you to your house; be gone, away!All will be naught else.

Second Senator

Get you gone.

COMINIUS

Stand fast;We have as many friends as enemies.

MENENIUS

Sham it be put to that?

First Senator

The gods forbid!I prithee, noble friend, home to thy house;Leave us to cure this cause.

MENENIUS

For 'tis a sore upon us,You cannot tent yourself: be gone, beseech you.

COMINIUS

Come, sir, along with us.

CORIOLANUS

I would they were barbarians--as they are,Though in Rome litter'd--not Romans--as they are not,Though calved i' the porch o' the Capitol--

MENENIUS

Be gone;Put not your worthy rage into your tongue;One time will owe another.

CORIOLANUS

On fair groundI could beat forty of them.

COMINIUS

I could myselfTake up a brace o' the best of them; yea, thetwo tribunes:But now 'tis odds beyond arithmetic;And manhood is call'd foolery, when it standsAgainst a falling fabric. Will you hence,Before the tag return? whose rage doth rendLike interrupted waters and o'erbearWhat they are used to bear.

MENENIUS

Pray you, be gone:I'll try whether my old wit be in requestWith those that have but little: this must be patch'dWith cloth of any colour.

COMINIUS

Nay, come away.Exeunt CORIOLANUS, COMINIUS, and others


A Patrician

This man has marr'd his fortune.

MENENIUS

His nature is too noble for the world:He would not flatter Neptune for his trident,Or Jove for's power to thunder. His heart's his mouth:What his breast forges, that his tongue must vent;And, being angry, does forget that everHe heard the name of death.A noise within
Here's goodly work!

Second Patrician

I would they were abed!

MENENIUS

I would they were in Tiber! What the vengeance!Could he not speak 'em fair?Re-enter BRUTUS and SICINIUS, with the rabble


SICINIUS

Where is this viperThat would depopulate the city andBe every man himself?

MENENIUS

You worthy tribunes,--

SICINIUS

He shall be thrown down the Tarpeian rockWith rigorous hands: he hath resisted law,And therefore law shall scorn him further trialThan the severity of the public powerWhich he so sets at nought.

First Citizen

He shall well knowThe noble tribunes are the people's mouths,And we their hands.

Citizens

He shall, sure on't.

MENENIUS

Sir, sir,--

SICINIUS

Peace!

MENENIUS

Do not cry havoc, where you should but huntWith modest warrant.

SICINIUS

Sir, how comes't that youHave holp to make this rescue?

MENENIUS

Hear me speak:As I do know the consul's worthiness,So can I name his faults,--

SICINIUS

Consul! what consul?

MENENIUS

The consul Coriolanus.

BRUTUS

He consul!

Citizens

No, no, no, no, no.

MENENIUS

If, by the tribunes' leave, and yours, good people,I may be heard, I would crave a word or two;The which shall turn you to no further harmThan so much loss of time.

SICINIUS

Speak briefly then;For we are peremptory to dispatchThis viperous traitor: to eject him henceWere but one danger, and to keep him hereOur certain death: therefore it is decreedHe dies to-night.

MENENIUS

                  Now the good gods forbidThat our renowned Rome, whose gratitudeTowards her deserved children is enroll'dIn Jove's own book, like an unnatural damShould now eat up her own!

SICINIUS

He's a disease that must be cut away.

MENENIUS

O, he's a limb that has but a disease;Mortal, to cut it off; to cure it, easy.What has he done to Rome that's worthy death?Killing our enemies, the blood he hath lost--Which, I dare vouch, is more than that he hath,By many an ounce--he dropp'd it for his country;And what is left, to lose it by his country,Were to us all, that do't and suffer it,A brand to the end o' the world.

SICINIUS

This is clean kam.

BRUTUS

Merely awry: when he did love his country,It honour'd him.

MENENIUS

                  The service of the footBeing once gangrened, is not then respectedFor what before it was.

BRUTUS

We'll hear no more.Pursue him to his house, and pluck him thence:Lest his infection, being of catching nature,Spread further.

MENENIUS

                  One word more, one word.This tiger-footed rage, when it shall findThe harm of unscann'd swiftness, will too lateTie leaden pounds to's heels. Proceed by process;Lest parties, as he is beloved, break out,And sack great Rome with Romans.

BRUTUS

If it were so,--

SICINIUS

What do ye talk?Have we not had a taste of his obedience?Our aediles smote? ourselves resisted? Come.

MENENIUS

Consider this: he has been bred i' the warsSince he could draw a sword, and is ill school'dIn bolted language; meal and bran togetherHe throws without distinction. Give me leave,I'll go to him, and undertake to bring himWhere he shall answer, by a lawful form,In peace, to his utmost peril.

First Senator

Noble tribunes,It is the humane way: the other courseWill prove too bloody, and the end of itUnknown to the beginning.

SICINIUS

Noble Menenius,Be you then as the people's officer.Masters, lay down your weapons.

BRUTUS

Go not home.

SICINIUS

Meet on the market-place. We'll attend you there:Where, if you bring not Marcius, we'll proceedIn our first way.

MENENIUS

                  I'll bring him to you.To the Senators
Let me desire your company: he must come,Or what is worst will follow.

First Senator

Pray you, let's to him.Exeunt

SCENE II. A room in CORIOLANUS'S house.

Enter CORIOLANUS with Patricians


CORIOLANUS

Let them puff all about mine ears, present meDeath on the wheel or at wild horses' heels,Or pile ten hills on the Tarpeian rock,That the precipitation might down stretchBelow the beam of sight, yet will I stillBe thus to them.

A Patrician

You do the nobler.

CORIOLANUS

I muse my motherDoes not approve me further, who was wontTo call them woollen vassals, things createdTo buy and sell with groats, to show bare headsIn congregations, to yawn, be still and wonder,When one but of my ordinance stood upTo speak of peace or war.Enter VOLUMNIA
I talk of you:Why did you wish me milder? would you have meFalse to my nature? Rather say I playThe man I am.

VOLUMNIA

                  O, sir, sir, sir,I would have had you put your power well on,Before you had worn it out.

CORIOLANUS

Let go.

VOLUMNIA

You might have been enough the man you are,With striving less to be so; lesser had beenThe thwartings of your dispositions, ifYou had not show'd them how ye were disposedEre they lack'd power to cross you.

CORIOLANUS

Let them hang.

A Patrician

Ay, and burn too.Enter MENENIUS and Senators


MENENIUS

Come, come, you have been too rough, somethingtoo rough;You must return and mend it.

First Senator

There's no remedy;Unless, by not so doing, our good cityCleave in the midst, and perish.

VOLUMNIA

Pray, be counsell'd:I have a heart as little apt as yours,But yet a brain that leads my use of angerTo better vantage.

MENENIUS

                  Well said, noble woman?Before he should thus stoop to the herd, but thatThe violent fit o' the time craves it as physicFor the whole state, I would put mine armour on,Which I can scarcely bear.

CORIOLANUS

What must I do?

MENENIUS

Return to the tribunes.

CORIOLANUS

Well, what then? what then?

MENENIUS

Repent what you have spoke.

CORIOLANUS

For them! I cannot do it to the gods;Must I then do't to them?

VOLUMNIA

You are too absolute;Though therein you can never be too noble,But when extremities speak. I have heard you say,Honour and policy, like unsever'd friends,I' the war do grow together: grant that, and tell me,In peace what each of them by the other lose,That they combine not there.

CORIOLANUS

Tush, tush!

MENENIUS

A good demand.

VOLUMNIA

If it be honour in your wars to seemThe same you are not, which, for your best ends,You adopt your policy, how is it less or worse,That it shall hold companionship in peaceWith honour, as in war, since that to bothIt stands in like request?

CORIOLANUS

Why force you this?

VOLUMNIA

Because that now it lies you on to speakTo the people; not by your own instruction,Nor by the matter which your heart prompts you,But with such words that are but rooted inYour tongue, though but bastards and syllablesOf no allowance to your bosom's truth.Now, this no more dishonours you at allThan to take in a town with gentle words,Which else would put you to your fortune andThe hazard of much blood.I would dissemble with my nature whereMy fortunes and my friends at stake requiredI should do so in honour: I am in this,Your wife, your son, these senators, the nobles;And you will rather show our general loutsHow you can frown than spend a fawn upon 'em,For the inheritance of their loves and safeguardOf what that want might ruin.

MENENIUS

Noble lady!Come, go with us; speak fair: you may salve so,Not what is dangerous present, but the lossOf what is past.

VOLUMNIA

                  I prithee now, my son,Go to them, with this bonnet in thy hand;And thus far having stretch'd it--here be with them--Thy knee bussing the stones--for in such businessAction is eloquence, and the eyes of the ignorantMore learned than the ears--waving thy head,Which often, thus, correcting thy stout heart,Now humble as the ripest mulberryThat will not hold the handling: or say to them,Thou art their soldier, and being bred in broilsHast not the soft way which, thou dost confess,Were fit for thee to use as they to claim,In asking their good loves, but thou wilt frameThyself, forsooth, hereafter theirs, so farAs thou hast power and person.

MENENIUS

This but done,Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;For they have pardons, being ask'd, as freeAs words to little purpose.

VOLUMNIA

Prithee now,Go, and be ruled: although I know thou hadst ratherFollow thine enemy in a fiery gulfThan flatter him in a bower. Here is Cominius.Enter COMINIUS


COMINIUS

I have been i' the market-place; and, sir,'tis fitYou make strong party, or defend yourselfBy calmness or by absence: all's in anger.

MENENIUS

Only fair speech.

COMINIUS

                  I think 'twill serve, if heCan thereto frame his spirit.

VOLUMNIA

He must, and willPrithee now, say you will, and go about it.

CORIOLANUS

Must I go show them my unbarbed sconce?Must I with base tongue give my noble heartA lie that it must bear? Well, I will do't:Yet, were there but this single plot to lose,This mould of Marcius, they to dust should grind itAnd throw't against the wind. To the market-place!You have put me now to such a part which neverI shall discharge to the life.

COMINIUS

Come, come, we'll prompt you.

VOLUMNIA

I prithee now, sweet son, as thou hast saidMy praises made thee first a soldier, so,To have my praise for this, perform a partThou hast not done before.

CORIOLANUS

Well, I must do't:Away, my disposition, and possess meSome harlot's spirit! my throat of war be turn'd,Which quired with my drum, into a pipeSmall as an eunuch, or the virgin voiceThat babies lulls asleep! the smiles of knavesTent in my cheeks, and schoolboys' tears take upThe glasses of my sight! a beggar's tongueMake motion through my lips, and my arm'd knees,Who bow'd but in my stirrup, bend like hisThat hath received an alms! I will not do't,Lest I surcease to honour mine own truthAnd by my body's action teach my mindA most inherent baseness.

VOLUMNIA

At thy choice, then:To beg of thee, it is my more dishonourThan thou of them. Come all to ruin; letThy mother rather feel thy pride than fearThy dangerous stoutness, for I mock at deathWith as big heart as thou. Do as thou listThy valiantness was mine, thou suck'dst it from me,But owe thy pride thyself.

CORIOLANUS

Pray, be content:Mother, I am going to the market-place;Chide me no more. I'll mountebank their loves,Cog their hearts from them, and come home belovedOf all the trades in Rome. Look, I am going:Commend me to my wife. I'll return consul;Or never trust to what my tongue can doI' the way of flattery further.

VOLUMNIA

Do your will.Exit


COMINIUS

Away! the tribunes do attend you: arm yourselfTo answer mildly; for they are preparedWith accusations, as I hear, more strongThan are upon you yet.

CORIOLANUS

The word is 'mildly.' Pray you, let us go:Let them accuse me by invention, IWill answer in mine honour.

MENENIUS

Ay, but mildly.

CORIOLANUS

Well, mildly be it then. Mildly!Exeunt

SCENE III. The same. The Forum.

Enter SICINIUS and BRUTUS


BRUTUS

In this point charge him home, that he affectsTyrannical power: if he evade us there,Enforce him with his envy to the people,And that the spoil got on the AntiatesWas ne'er distributed.Enter an AEdile
What, will he come?

AEdile

He's coming.

BRUTUS

How accompanied?

AEdile

With old Menenius, and those senatorsThat always favour'd him.

SICINIUS

Have you a catalogueOf all the voices that we have procuredSet down by the poll?

AEdile

I have; 'tis ready.

SICINIUS

Have you collected them by tribes?

AEdile

I have.

SICINIUS

Assemble presently the people hither;And when they bear me say 'It shall be soI' the right and strength o' the commons,' be it eitherFor death, for fine, or banishment, then let themIf I say fine, cry 'Fine;' if death, cry 'Death.'Insisting on the old prerogativeAnd power i' the truth o' the cause.

AEdile

I shall inform them.

BRUTUS

And when such time they have begun to cry,Let them not cease, but with a din confusedEnforce the present executionOf what we chance to sentence.

AEdile

Very well.

SICINIUS

Make them be strong and ready for this hint,When we shall hap to give 't them.

BRUTUS

Go about it.Exit AEdile
Put him to choler straight: he hath been usedEver to conquer, and to have his worthOf contradiction: being once chafed, he cannotBe rein'd again to temperance; then he speaksWhat's in his heart; and that is there which looksWith us to break his neck.

SICINIUS

Well, here he comes.Enter CORIOLANUS, MENENIUS, and COMINIUS, with Senators and Patricians


MENENIUS

Calmly, I do beseech you.

CORIOLANUS

Ay, as an ostler, that for the poorest pieceWill bear the knave by the volume. The honour'd godsKeep Rome in safety, and the chairs of justiceSupplied with worthy men! plant love among 's!Throng our large temples with the shows of peace,And not our streets with war!

First Senator

Amen, amen.

MENENIUS

A noble wish.Re-enter AEdile, with Citizens


SICINIUS

Draw near, ye people.

AEdile

List to your tribunes. Audience: peace, I say!

CORIOLANUS

First, hear me speak.

Both Tribunes

Well, say. Peace, ho!

CORIOLANUS

Shall I be charged no further than this present?Must all determine here?

SICINIUS

I do demand,If you submit you to the people's voices,Allow their officers and are contentTo suffer lawful censure for such faultsAs shall be proved upon you?

CORIOLANUS

I am content.

MENENIUS

Lo, citizens, he says he is content:The warlike service he has done, consider; thinkUpon the wounds his body bears, which showLike graves i' the holy churchyard.

CORIOLANUS

Scratches with briers,Scars to move laughter only.

MENENIUS

Consider further,That when he speaks not like a citizen,You find him like a soldier: do not takeHis rougher accents for malicious sounds,But, as I say, such as become a soldier,Rather than envy you.

COMINIUS

Well, well, no more.

CORIOLANUS

What is the matterThat being pass'd for consul with full voice,I am so dishonour'd that the very hourYou take it off again?

SICINIUS

Answer to us.

CORIOLANUS

Say, then: 'tis true, I ought so.

SICINIUS

We charge you, that you have contrived to takeFrom Rome all season'd office and to windYourself into a power tyrannical;For which you are a traitor to the people.

CORIOLANUS

How! traitor!

MENENIUS

                  Nay, temperately; your promise.

CORIOLANUS

The fires i' the lowest hell fold-in the people!Call me their traitor! Thou injurious tribune!Within thine eyes sat twenty thousand deaths,In thy hand clutch'd as many millions, inThy lying tongue both numbers, I would say'Thou liest' unto thee with a voice as freeAs I do pray the gods.

SICINIUS

Mark you this, people?

Citizens

To the rock, to the rock with him!

SICINIUS

Peace!We need not put new matter to his charge:What you have seen him do and heard him speak,Beating your officers, cursing yourselves,Opposing laws with strokes and here defyingThose whose great power must try him; even this,So criminal and in such capital kind,Deserves the extremest death.

BRUTUS

But since he hathServed well for Rome,--

CORIOLANUS

What do you prate of service?

BRUTUS

I talk of that, that know it.

CORIOLANUS

You?

MENENIUS

Is this the promise that you made your mother?

COMINIUS

Know, I pray you,--

CORIOLANUS

I know no further:Let them pronounce the steep Tarpeian death,Vagabond exile, raying, pent to lingerBut with a grain a day, I would not buyTheir mercy at the price of one fair word;Nor cheque my courage for what they can give,To have't with saying 'Good morrow.'

SICINIUS

For that he has,As much as in him lies, from time to timeEnvied against the people, seeking meansTo pluck away their power, as now at lastGiven hostile strokes, and that not in the presenceOf dreaded justice, but on the ministersThat do distribute it; in the name o' the peopleAnd in the power of us the tribunes, we,Even from this instant, banish him our city,In peril of precipitationFrom off the rock Tarpeian never moreTo enter our Rome gates: i' the people's name,I say it shall be so.

Citizens

It shall be so, it shall be so; let him away:He's banish'd, and it shall be so.

COMINIUS

Hear me, my masters, and my common friends,--

SICINIUS

He's sentenced; no more hearing.

COMINIUS

Let me speak:I have been consul, and can show for RomeHer enemies' marks upon me. I do loveMy country's good with a respect more tender,More holy and profound, than mine own life,My dear wife's estimate, her womb's increase,And treasure of my loins; then if I wouldSpeak that,--

SICINIUS

                  We know your drift: speak what?

BRUTUS

There's no more to be said, but he is banish'd,As enemy to the people and his country:It shall be so.

Citizens

It shall be so, it shall be so.

CORIOLANUS

You common cry of curs! whose breath I hateAs reek o' the rotten fens, whose loves I prizeAs the dead carcasses of unburied menThat do corrupt my air, I banish you;And here remain with your uncertainty!Let every feeble rumour shake your hearts!Your enemies, with nodding of their plumes,Fan you into despair! Have the power stillTo banish your defenders; till at lengthYour ignorance, which finds not till it feels,Making not reservation of yourselves,Still your own foes, deliver you as mostAbated captives to some nationThat won you without blows! Despising,For you, the city, thus I turn my back:There is a world elsewhere.Exeunt CORIOLANUS, COMINIUS, MENENIUS, Senators, and Patricians


AEdile

The people's enemy is gone, is gone!

Citizens

Our enemy is banish'd! he is gone! Hoo! hoo!Shouting, and throwing up their caps


SICINIUS

Go, see him out at gates, and follow him,As he hath followed you, with all despite;Give him deserved vexation. Let a guardAttend us through the city.

Citizens

Come, come; let's see him out at gates; come.The gods preserve our noble tribunes! Come.Exeunt

ACT IV
SCENE I. Rome. Before a gate of the city.

Enter CORIOLANUS, VOLUMNIA, VIRGILIA, MENENIUS, COMINIUS, with the young Nobility of Rome


CORIOLANUS

Come, leave your tears: a brief farewell: the beastWith many heads butts me away. Nay, mother,Where is your ancient courage? you were usedTo say extremity was the trier of spirits;That common chances common men could bear;That when the sea was calm all boats alikeShow'd mastership in floating; fortune's blows,When most struck home, being gentle wounded, cravesA noble cunning: you were used to load meWith precepts that would make invincibleThe heart that conn'd them.

VIRGILIA

O heavens! O heavens!

CORIOLANUS

Nay! prithee, woman,--

VOLUMNIA

Now the red pestilence strike all trades in Rome,And occupations perish!

CORIOLANUS

What, what, what!I shall be loved when I am lack'd. Nay, mother.Resume that spirit, when you were wont to say,If you had been the wife of Hercules,Six of his labours you'ld have done, and savedYour husband so much sweat. Cominius,Droop not; adieu. Farewell, my wife, my mother:I'll do well yet. Thou old and true Menenius,Thy tears are salter than a younger man's,And venomous to thine eyes. My sometime general,I have seen thee stem, and thou hast oft beheldHeart-hardening spectacles; tell these sad women'Tis fond to wail inevitable strokes,As 'tis to laugh at 'em. My mother, you wot wellMy hazards still have been your solace: andBelieve't not lightly--though I go alone,Like to a lonely dragon, that his fenMakes fear'd and talk'd of more than seen--your sonWill or exceed the common or be caughtWith cautelous baits and practise.

VOLUMNIA

My first son.Whither wilt thou go? Take good CominiusWith thee awhile: determine on some course,More than a wild exposture to each chanceThat starts i' the way before thee.

CORIOLANUS

O the gods!

COMINIUS

I'll follow thee a month, devise with theeWhere thou shalt rest, that thou mayst hear of usAnd we of thee: so if the time thrust forthA cause for thy repeal, we shall not sendO'er the vast world to seek a single man,And lose advantage, which doth ever coolI' the absence of the needer.

CORIOLANUS

Fare ye well:Thou hast years upon thee; and thou art too fullOf the wars' surfeits, to go rove with oneThat's yet unbruised: bring me but out at gate.Come, my sweet wife, my dearest mother, andMy friends of noble touch, when I am forth,Bid me farewell, and smile. I pray you, come.While I remain above the ground, you shallHear from me still, and never of me aughtBut what is like me formerly.

MENENIUS

That's worthilyAs any ear can hear. Come, let's not weep.If I could shake off but one seven yearsFrom these old arms and legs, by the good gods,I'ld with thee every foot.

CORIOLANUS

Give me thy hand: Come.Exeunt

SCENE II. The same. A  street near the gate.

Enter SICINIUS, BRUTUS, and an AEdile


SICINIUS

Bid them all home; he's gone, and we'll no further.The nobility are vex'd, whom we see have sidedIn his behalf.

BRUTUS

                  Now we have shown our power,Let us seem humbler after it is doneThan when it was a-doing.

SICINIUS

Bid them home:Say their great enemy is gone, and theyStand in their ancient strength.

BRUTUS

Dismiss them home.Exit AEdile
Here comes his mother.

SICINIUS

Let's not meet her.

BRUTUS

Why?

SICINIUS

They say she's mad.

BRUTUS

They have ta'en note of us: keep on your way.Enter VOLUMNIA, VIRGILIA, and MENENIUS


VOLUMNIA

O, ye're well met: the hoarded plague o' the godsRequite your love!

MENENIUS

                  Peace, peace; be not so loud.

VOLUMNIA

If that I could for weeping, you should hear,--Nay, and you shall hear some.To BRUTUS
Will you be gone?

VIRGILIA

[To SICINIUS]  You shall stay too: I would I had the powerTo say so to my husband.

SICINIUS

Are  you mankind?

VOLUMNIA

Ay, fool; is that a shame? Note but this fool.Was not a man my father? Hadst thou foxshipTo banish him that struck more blows for RomeThan thou hast spoken words?

SICINIUS

O blessed heavens!

VOLUMNIA

More noble blows than ever thou wise words;And for Rome's good. I'll tell thee what; yet go:Nay, but thou shalt stay too: I would my sonWere in Arabia, and thy tribe before him,His good sword in his hand.

SICINIUS

What then?

VIRGILIA

What then!He'ld make an end of thy posterity.

VOLUMNIA

Bastards and all.Good man, the wounds that he does bear for Rome!

MENENIUS

Come, come, peace.

SICINIUS

I would he had continued to his countryAs he began, and not unknit himselfThe noble knot he made.

BRUTUS

I would he had.

VOLUMNIA

'I would he had'! 'Twas you incensed the rabble:Cats, that can judge as fitly of his worthAs I can of those mysteries which heavenWill not have earth to know.

BRUTUS

Pray, let us go.

VOLUMNIA

Now, pray, sir, get you gone:You have done a brave deed. Ere you go, hear this:--As far as doth the Capitol exceedThe meanest house in Rome, so far my son--This lady's husband here, this, do you see--Whom you have banish'd, does exceed you all.

BRUTUS

Well, well, we'll leave you.

SICINIUS

Why stay we to be baitedWith one that wants her wits?

VOLUMNIA

Take my prayers with you.Exeunt Tribunes
I would the gods had nothing else to doBut to confirm my curses! Could I meet 'emBut once a-day, it would unclog my heartOf what lies heavy to't.

MENENIUS

You have told them home;And, by my troth, you have cause. You'll sup with me?

VOLUMNIA

Anger's my meat; I sup upon myself,And so shall starve with feeding. Come, let's go:Leave this faint puling and lament as I do,In anger, Juno-like. Come, come, come.

MENENIUS

Fie, fie, fie!Exeunt

SCENE III. A highway between Rome and Antium.

Enter a Roman and a Volsce, meeting


Roman

I know you well, sir, and you knowme: your name, I think, is Adrian.

Volsce

It is so, sir: truly, I have forgot you.

Roman

I am a Roman; and my services are,as you are, against 'em: know you me yet?

Volsce

Nicanor? no.

Roman

The same, sir.

Volsce

You had more beard when I last saw you; but yourfavour is well approved by your tongue. What's thenews in Rome? I have a note from the Volscian state,to find you out there: you have well saved me aday's journey.

Roman

There hath been in Rome strange insurrections; thepeople against the senators, patricians, and nobles.

Volsce

Hath been! is it ended, then? Our state thinks notso: they are in a most warlike preparation, andhope to come upon them in the heat of their division.

Roman

The main blaze of it is past, but a small thingwould make it flame again: for the nobles receiveso to heart the banishment of that worthyCoriolanus, that they are in a ripe aptness to takeall power from the people and to pluck from themtheir tribunes for ever. This lies glowing, I cantell you, and is almost mature for the violentbreaking out.

Volsce

Coriolanus banished!

Roman

Banished, sir.

Volsce

You will be welcome with this intelligence, Nicanor.

Roman

The day serves well for them now. I have heard itsaid, the fittest time to corrupt a man's wife iswhen she's fallen out with her husband. Your nobleTullus Aufidius will appear well in these wars, hisgreat opposer, Coriolanus, being now in no requestof his country.

Volsce

He cannot choose. I am most fortunate, thusaccidentally to encounter you: you have ended mybusiness, and I will merrily accompany you home.

Roman

I shall, between this and supper, tell you moststrange things from Rome; all tending to the good oftheir adversaries. Have you an army ready, say you?

Volsce

A most royal one; the centurions and their charges,distinctly billeted, already in the entertainment,and to be on foot at an hour's warning.

Roman

I am joyful to hear of their readiness, and am theman, I think, that shall set them in present action.So, sir, heartily well met, and most glad of your company.

Volsce

You take my part from me, sir; I have the most causeto be glad of yours.

Roman

Well, let us go together.Exeunt

SCENE IV. Antium. Before Aufidius's house.

Enter CORIOLANUS in mean apparel, disguised and muffled


CORIOLANUS

A goodly city is this Antium. City,'Tis I that made thy widows: many an heirOf these fair edifices 'fore my warsHave I heard groan and drop: then know me not,Lest that thy wives with spits and boys with stonesIn puny battle slay me.Enter a Citizen
Save you, sir.

Citizen

And you.

CORIOLANUS

       Direct me, if it be your will,Where great Aufidius lies: is he in Antium?

Citizen

He is, and feasts the nobles of the stateAt his house this night.

CORIOLANUS

Which is his house, beseech you?

Citizen

This, here before you.

CORIOLANUS

Thank you, sir: farewell.Exit Citizen
O world, thy slippery turns! Friends now fast sworn,Whose double bosoms seem to wear one heart,Whose house, whose bed, whose meal, and exercise,Are still together, who twin, as 'twere, in loveUnseparable, shall within this hour,On a dissension of a doit, break outTo bitterest enmity: so, fellest foes,Whose passions and whose plots have broke their sleep,To take the one the other, by some chance,Some trick not worth an egg, shall grow dear friendsAnd interjoin their issues. So with me:My birth-place hate I, and my love's uponThis enemy town. I'll enter: if he slay me,He does fair justice; if he give me way,I'll do his country service.Exit

SCENE V. The same. A hall in Aufidius's house.

CORIOLANUS

I have deserved no better entertainment,In being Coriolanus.Re-enter second Servingman


Second Servingman

Whence are you, sir? Has the porter his eyes in hishead; that he gives entrance to such companions?Pray, get you out.

CORIOLANUS

Away!

Second Servingman

Away! get you away.

CORIOLANUS

Now thou'rt troublesome.

Second Servingman

Are you so brave? I'll have you talked with anon.Enter a third Servingman. The first meets him


Third Servingman

What fellow's this?

First Servingman

A strange one as ever I looked on: I cannot get himout of the house: prithee, call my master to him.Retires


Third Servingman

What have you to do here, fellow? Pray you, avoidthe house.

CORIOLANUS

Let me but stand; I will not hurt your hearth.

Third Servingman

What are you?

CORIOLANUS

A gentleman.

Third Servingman

A marvellous poor one.

CORIOLANUS

True, so I am.

Third Servingman

Pray you, poor gentleman, take up some otherstation; here's no place for you; pray you, avoid: come.

CORIOLANUS

Follow your function, go, and batten on cold bits.Pushes him away

CORIOLANUS

Ay.

Third Servingman

Where's that?

CORIOLANUS

I' the city of kites and crows.

Third Servingman

I' the city of kites and crows! What an ass it is!Then thou dwellest with daws too?

CORIOLANUS

No, I serve not thy master.

Third Servingman

How, sir! do you meddle with my master?

CORIOLANUS

Ay; 'tis an honester service than to meddle with thymistress. Thou pratest, and pratest; serve with thytrencher, hence!Beats him away. Exit third Servingman
Enter AUFIDIUS with the second Servingman


AUFIDIUS

Where is this fellow?

Second Servingman

Here, sir: I'ld have beaten him like a dog, but fordisturbing the lords within.Retires


AUFIDIUS

Whence comest thou? what wouldst thou? thy name?Why speak'st not? speak, man: what's thy name?

CORIOLANUS

If, Tullus,Unmuffling
Not yet thou knowest me, and, seeing me, dost notThink me for the man I am, necessityCommands me name myself.

AUFIDIUS

What is thy name?

CORIOLANUS

A name unmusical to the Volscians' ears,And harsh in sound to thine.

AUFIDIUS

Say, what's thy name?Thou hast a grim appearance, and thy faceBears a command in't; though thy tackle's torn.Thou show'st a noble vessel: what's thy name?

CORIOLANUS

Prepare thy brow to frown: know'stthou me yet?

AUFIDIUS

I know thee not: thy name?

CORIOLANUS

My name is Caius Marcius, who hath doneTo thee particularly and to all the VolscesGreat hurt and mischief; thereto witness mayMy surname, Coriolanus: the painful service,The extreme dangers and the drops of bloodShed for my thankless country are requitedBut with that surname; a good memory,And witness of the malice and displeasureWhich thou shouldst bear me: only that name remains;The cruelty and envy of the people,Permitted by our dastard nobles, whoHave all forsook me, hath devour'd the rest;And suffer'd me by the voice of slaves to beWhoop'd out of Rome. Now this extremityHath brought me to thy hearth; not out of hope--Mistake me not--to save my life, for ifI had fear'd death, of all the men i' the worldI would have 'voided thee, but in mere spite,To be full quit of those my banishers,Stand I before thee here. Then if thou hastA heart of wreak in thee, that wilt revengeThine own particular wrongs and stop those maimsOf shame seen through thy country, speedthee straight,And make my misery serve thy turn: so use itThat my revengeful services may proveAs benefits to thee, for I will fightAgainst my canker'd country with the spleenOf all the under fiends. But if so beThou darest not this and that to prove more fortunesThou'rt tired, then, in a word, I also amLonger to live most weary, and presentMy throat to thee and to thy ancient malice;Which not to cut would show thee but a fool,Since I have ever follow'd thee with hate,Drawn tuns of blood out of thy country's breast,And cannot live but to thy shame, unlessIt be to do thee service.

AUFIDIUS

O Marcius, Marcius!Each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heartA root of ancient envy. If JupiterShould from yond cloud speak divine things,And say 'Tis true,' I'ld not believe them moreThan thee, all noble Marcius. Let me twineMine arms about that body, where againstMy grained ash an hundred times hath brokeAnd scarr'd the moon with splinters: here I clipThe anvil of my sword, and do contestAs hotly and as nobly with thy loveAs ever in ambitious strength I didContend against thy valour. Know thou first,I loved the maid I married; never manSigh'd truer breath; but that I see thee here,Thou noble thing! more dances my rapt heartThan when I first my wedded mistress sawBestride my threshold. Why, thou Mars! I tell thee,We have a power on foot; and I had purposeOnce more to hew thy target from thy brawn,Or lose mine arm fort: thou hast beat me outTwelve several times, and I have nightly sinceDreamt of encounters 'twixt thyself and me;We have been down together in my sleep,Unbuckling helms, fisting each other's throat,And waked half dead with nothing. Worthy Marcius,Had we no quarrel else to Rome, but thatThou art thence banish'd, we would muster allFrom twelve to seventy, and pouring warInto the bowels of ungrateful Rome,Like a bold flood o'er-bear. O, come, go in,And take our friendly senators by the hands;Who now are here, taking their leaves of me,Who am prepared against your territories,Though not for Rome itself.

CORIOLANUS

You bless me, gods!

AUFIDIUS

Therefore, most absolute sir, if thou wilt haveThe leading of thine own revenges, takeThe one half of my commission; and set down--As best thou art experienced, since thou know'stThy country's strength and weakness,--thine own ways;Whether to knock against the gates of Rome,Or rudely visit them in parts remote,To fright them, ere destroy. But come in:Let me commend thee first to those that shallSay yea to thy desires. A thousand welcomes!And more a friend than e'er an enemy;Yet, Marcius, that was much. Your hand: most welcome!Exeunt CORIOLANUS and AUFIDIUS. The two Servingmen come forward


First Servingman

Here's a strange alteration!

Second Servingman

By my hand, I had thought to have strucken him witha cudgel; and yet my mind gave me his clothes made afalse report of him.

First Servingman

What an arm he has! he turned me about with hisfinger and his thumb, as one would set up a top.

Second Servingman

Nay, I knew by his face that there was something inhim: he had, sir, a kind of face, methought,--Icannot tell how to term it.

First Servingman

He had so; looking as it were--would I were hanged,but I thought there was more in him than I could think.

Second Servingman

So did I, I'll be sworn: he is simply the rarestman i' the world.

First Servingman

I think he is: but a greater soldier than he you wot on.

Second Servingman

Who, my master?

First Servingman

Nay, it's no matter for that.

Second Servingman

Worth six on him.

First Servingman

Nay, not so neither: but I take him to be thegreater soldier.

Second Servingman

Faith, look you, one cannot tell how to say that:for the defence of a town, our general is excellent.

First Servingman

Ay, and for an assault too.Re-enter third Servingman


Third Servingman

O slaves, I can tell you news,-- news, you rascals!

First Servingman

Second Servingman

What, what, what? let's partake.

Third Servingman

I would not be a Roman, of all nations; I had aslieve be a condemned man.

First Servingman

Second Servingman

Wherefore? wherefore?

Third Servingman

Why, here's he that was wont to thwack our general,Caius Marcius.

First Servingman

Why do you say 'thwack our general '?

Third Servingman

I do not say 'thwack our general;' but he was alwaysgood enough for him.

Second Servingman

Come, we are fellows and friends: he was ever toohard for him; I have heard him say so himself.

First Servingman

He was too hard for him directly, to say the trothon't: before Corioli he scotched him and notchedhim like a carbon ado.

Second Servingman

An he had been cannibally given, he might havebroiled and eaten him too.

First Servingman

But, more of thy news?

Third Servingman

Why, he is so made on here within, as if he were sonand heir to Mars; set at upper end o' the table; noquestion asked him by any of the senators, but theystand bald before him: our general himself makes amistress of him: sanctifies himself with's hand andturns up the white o' the eye to his discourse. Butthe bottom of the news is that our general is cut i'the middle and but one half of what he wasyesterday; for the other has half, by the entreatyand grant of the whole table. He'll go, he says,and sowl the porter of Rome gates by the ears: hewill mow all down before him, and leave his passage polled.

Second Servingman

And he's as like to do't as any man I can imagine.

Third Servingman

Do't! he will do't; for, look you, sir, he has asmany friends as enemies; which friends, sir, as itwere, durst not, look you, sir, show themselves, aswe term it, his friends whilst he's in directitude.

First Servingman

Directitude! what's that?

Third Servingman

But when they shall see, sir, his crest up again,and the man in blood, they will out of theirburrows, like conies after rain, and revel all withhim.

First Servingman

But when goes this forward?

Third Servingman

To-morrow; to-day; presently; you shall have thedrum struck up this afternoon: 'tis, as it were, aparcel of their feast, and to be executed ere theywipe their lips.

Second Servingman

Why, then we shall have a stirring world again.This peace is nothing, but to rust iron, increasetailors, and breed ballad-makers.

First Servingman

Let me have war, say I; it exceeds peace as far asday does night; it's spritely, waking, audible, andfull of vent. Peace is a very apoplexy, lethargy;mulled, deaf, sleepy, insensible; a getter of morebastard children than war's a destroyer of men.

Second Servingman

'Tis so: and as war, in some sort, may be said tobe a ravisher, so it cannot be denied but peace is agreat maker of cuckolds.

First Servingman

Ay, and it makes men hate one another.

Third Servingman

Reason; because they then less need one another.The wars for my money. I hope to see Romans as cheapas Volscians. They are rising, they are rising.

All

In, in, in, in!Exeunt

SCENE VI. Rome. A public place.

Enter SICINIUS and BRUTUS


SICINIUS

We hear not of him, neither need we fear him;His remedies are tame i' the present peaceAnd quietness of the people, which beforeWere in wild hurry. Here do we make his friendsBlush that the world goes well, who rather had,Though they themselves did suffer by't, beholdDissentious numbers pestering streets than seeOur tradesmen with in their shops and goingAbout their functions friendly.

BRUTUS

We stood to't in good time.Enter MENENIUS
Is this Menenius?

SICINIUS

'Tis he,'tis he: O, he is grown most kind of late.

Both Tribunes

Hail sir!

MENENIUS

        Hail to you both!

SICINIUS

Your CoriolanusIs not much miss'd, but with his friends:The commonwealth doth stand, and so would do,Were he more angry at it.

MENENIUS

All's well; and might have been much better, ifHe could have temporized.

SICINIUS

Where is he, hear you?

MENENIUS

Nay, I hear nothing: his mother and his wifeHear nothing from him.Enter three or four Citizens


Citizens

The gods preserve you both!

SICINIUS

God-den, our neighbours.

BRUTUS

God-den to you all, god-den to you all.

First Citizen

Ourselves, our wives, and children, on our knees,Are bound to pray for you both.

SICINIUS

Live, and thrive!

BRUTUS

Farewell, kind neighbours: we wish'd CoriolanusHad loved you as we did.

Citizens

Now the gods keep you!

Both Tribunes

Farewell, farewell.Exeunt Citizens


SICINIUS

This is a happier and more comely timeThan when these fellows ran about the streets,Crying confusion.

BRUTUS

                  Caius Marcius wasA worthy officer i' the war; but insolent,O'ercome with pride, ambitious past all thinking,Self-loving,--

SICINIUS

                  And affecting one sole throne,Without assistance.

MENENIUS

I think not so.

SICINIUS

We should by this, to all our lamentation,If he had gone forth consul, found it so.

BRUTUS

The gods have well prevented it, and RomeSits safe and still without him.Enter an AEdile


AEdile

Worthy tribunes,There is a slave, whom we have put in prison,Reports, the Volsces with two several powersAre enter'd in the Roman territories,And with the deepest malice of the warDestroy what lies before 'em.

MENENIUS

'Tis Aufidius,Who, hearing of our Marcius' banishment,Thrusts forth his horns again into the world;Which were inshell'd when Marcius stood for Rome,And durst not once peep out.

SICINIUS

Come, what talk youOf Marcius?

BRUTUS

Go see this rumourer whipp'd. It cannot beThe Volsces dare break with us.

MENENIUS

Cannot be!We have record that very well it can,And three examples of the like have beenWithin my age. But reason with the fellow,Before you punish him, where he heard this,Lest you shall chance to whip your informationAnd beat the messenger who bids bewareOf what is to be dreaded.

SICINIUS

Tell not me:I know this cannot be.

BRUTUS

Not possible.Enter a Messenger


Messenger

The nobles in great earnestness are goingAll to the senate-house: some news is comeThat turns their countenances.

SICINIUS

'Tis this slave;--Go whip him, 'fore the people's eyes:--his raising;Nothing but his report.

Messenger

Yes, worthy sir,The slave's report is seconded; and more,More fearful, is deliver'd.

SICINIUS

What more fearful?

Messenger

It is spoke freely out of many mouths--How probable I do not know--that Marcius,Join'd with Aufidius, leads a power 'gainst Rome,And vows revenge as spacious as betweenThe young'st and oldest thing.

SICINIUS

This is most likely!

BRUTUS

Raised only, that the weaker sort may wishGood Marcius home again.

SICINIUS

The very trick on't.

MENENIUS

This is unlikely:He and Aufidius can no more atoneThan violentest contrariety.Enter a second Messenger


Second Messenger

You are sent for to the senate:A fearful army, led by Caius MarciusAssociated with Aufidius, ragesUpon our territories; and have alreadyO'erborne their way, consumed with fire, and tookWhat lay before them.Enter COMINIUS


COMINIUS

O, you have made good work!

MENENIUS

What news? what news?

COMINIUS

You have holp to ravish your own daughters andTo melt the city leads upon your pates,To see your wives dishonour'd to your noses,--

MENENIUS

What's the news? what's the news?

COMINIUS

Your temples burned in their cement, andYour franchises, whereon you stood, confinedInto an auger's bore.

MENENIUS

Pray now, your news?You have made fair work, I fear me.--Pray, your news?--If Marcius should be join'd with Volscians,--

COMINIUS

If!He is their god: he leads them like a thingMade by some other deity than nature,That shapes man better; and they follow him,Against us brats, with no less confidenceThan boys pursuing summer butterflies,Or butchers killing flies.

MENENIUS

You have made good work,You and your apron-men; you that stood so up muchon the voice of occupation andThe breath of garlic-eaters!

COMINIUS

He will shakeYour Rome about your ears.

MENENIUS

As HerculesDid shake down mellow fruit.You have made fair work!

BRUTUS

But is this true, sir?

COMINIUS

Ay; and you'll look paleBefore you find it other. All the regionsDo smilingly revolt; and who resistAre mock'd for valiant ignorance,And perish constant fools. Who is't can blame him?Your enemies and his find something in him.

MENENIUS

We are all undone, unlessThe noble man have mercy.

COMINIUS

Who shall ask it?The tribunes cannot do't for shame; the peopleDeserve such pity of him as the wolfDoes of the shepherds: for his best friends, if theyShould say 'Be good to Rome,' they charged him evenAs those should do that had deserved his hate,And therein show'd like enemies.

MENENIUS

'Tis true:If he were putting to my house the brandThat should consume it, I have not the faceTo say 'Beseech you, cease.' You have made fair hands,You and your crafts! you have crafted fair!

COMINIUS

You have broughtA trembling upon Rome, such as was neverSo incapable of help.

Both Tribunes

Say not we brought it.

MENENIUS

How! Was it we? we loved him but, like beastsAnd cowardly nobles, gave way unto your clusters,Who did hoot him out o' the city.

COMINIUS

But I fearThey'll roar him in again. Tullus Aufidius,The second name of men, obeys his pointsAs if he were his officer: desperationIs all the policy, strength and defence,That Rome can make against them.Enter a troop of Citizens


MENENIUS

Here come the clusters.And is Aufidius with him? You are theyThat made the air unwholesome, when you castYour stinking greasy caps in hooting atCoriolanus' exile. Now he's coming;And not a hair upon a soldier's headWhich will not prove a whip: as many coxcombsAs you threw caps up will he tumble down,And pay you for your voices. 'Tis no matter;if he could burn us all into one coal,We have deserved it.

Citizens

Faith, we hear fearful news.

First Citizen

For mine own part,When I said, banish him, I said 'twas pity.

Second Citizen

And so did I.

Third Citizen

And so did I; and, to say the truth, so did verymany of us: that we did, we did for the best; andthough we willingly consented to his banishment, yetit was against our will.

COMINIUS

Ye re goodly things, you voices!

MENENIUS

You have madeGood work, you and your cry! Shall's to the Capitol?

COMINIUS

O, ay, what else?Exeunt COMINIUS and MENENIUS


SICINIUS

Go, masters, get you home; be not dismay'd:These are a side that would be glad to haveThis true which they so seem to fear. Go home,And show no sign of fear.

First Citizen

The gods be good to us! Come, masters, let's home.I ever said we were i' the wrong when we banishedhim.

Second Citizen

So did we all. But, come, let's home.Exeunt Citizens


BRUTUS

I do not like this news.

SICINIUS

Nor I.

BRUTUS

Let's to the Capitol. Would half my wealthWould buy this for a lie!

SICINIUS

Pray, let us go.Exeunt

SCENE VII. A camp, at a small distance from Rome.

Enter AUFIDIUS and his Lieutenant


AUFIDIUS

Do they still fly to the Roman?

Lieutenant

I do not know what witchcraft's in him, butYour soldiers use him as the grace 'fore meat,Their talk at table, and their thanks at end;And you are darken'd in this action, sir,Even by your own.

AUFIDIUS

                  I cannot help it now,Unless, by using means, I lame the footOf our design. He bears himself more proudlier,Even to my person, than I thought he wouldWhen first I did embrace him: yet his natureIn that's no changeling; and I must excuseWhat cannot be amended.

Lieutenant

Yet I wish, sir,--I mean for your particular,--you had notJoin'd in commission with him; but eitherHad borne the action of yourself, or elseTo him had left it solely.

AUFIDIUS

I understand thee well; and be thou sure,when he shall come to his account, he knows notWhat I can urge against him. Although it seems,And so he thinks, and is no less apparentTo the vulgar eye, that he bears all things fairly.And shows good husbandry for the Volscian state,Fights dragon-like, and does achieve as soonAs draw his sword; yet he hath left undoneThat which shall break his neck or hazard mine,Whene'er we come to our account.

Lieutenant

Sir, I beseech you, think you he'll carry Rome?

AUFIDIUS

All places yield to him ere he sits down;And the nobility of Rome are his:The senators and patricians love him too:The tribunes are no soldiers; and their peopleWill be as rash in the repeal, as hastyTo expel him thence. I think he'll be to RomeAs is the osprey to the fish, who takes itBy sovereignty of nature. First he wasA noble servant to them; but he could notCarry his honours even: whether 'twas pride,Which out of daily fortune ever taintsThe happy man; whether defect of judgment,To fail in the disposing of those chancesWhich he was lord of; or whether nature,Not to be other than one thing, not movingFrom the casque to the cushion, but commanding peaceEven with the same austerity and garbAs he controll'd the war; but one of these--As he hath spices of them all, not all,For I dare so far free him--made him fear'd,So hated, and so banish'd: but he has a merit,To choke it in the utterance. So our virtuesLie in the interpretation of the time:And power, unto itself most commendable,Hath not a tomb so evident as a chairTo extol what it hath done.One fire drives out one fire; one nail, one nail;Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.Come, let's away. When, Caius, Rome is thine,Thou art poor'st of all; then shortly art thou mine.Exeunt

ACT V
SCENE I. Rome. A public place.

Enter MENENIUS, COMINIUS, SICINIUS, BRUTUS, and others


MENENIUS

No, I'll not go: you hear what he hath saidWhich was sometime his general; who loved himIn a most dear particular. He call'd me father:But what o' that? Go, you that banish'd him;A mile before his tent fall down, and kneeThe way into his mercy: nay, if he coy'dTo hear Cominius speak, I'll keep at home.

COMINIUS

He would not seem to know me.

MENENIUS

Do you hear?

COMINIUS

Yet one time he did call me by my name:I urged our old acquaintance, and the dropsThat we have bled together. CoriolanusHe would not answer to: forbad all names;He was a kind of nothing, titleless,Till he had forged himself a name o' the fireOf burning Rome.

MENENIUS

Why, so: you have made good work!A pair of tribunes that have rack'd for Rome,To make coals cheap,--a noble memory!

COMINIUS

I minded him how royal 'twas to pardonWhen it was less expected: he replied,It was a bare petition of a stateTo one whom they had punish'd.

MENENIUS

Very well:Could he say less?

COMINIUS

I offer'd to awaken his regardFor's private friends: his answer to me was,He could not stay to pick them in a pileOf noisome musty chaff: he said 'twas folly,For one poor grain or two, to leave unburnt,And still to nose the offence.

MENENIUS

For one poor grain or two!I am one of those; his mother, wife, his child,And this brave fellow too, we are the grains:You are the musty chaff; and you are smeltAbove the moon: we must be burnt for you.

SICINIUS

Nay, pray, be patient: if you refuse your aidIn this so never-needed help, yet do notUpbraid's with our distress. But, sure, if youWould be your country's pleader, your good tongue,More than the instant army we can make,Might stop our countryman.

MENENIUS

No, I'll not meddle.

SICINIUS

Pray you, go to him.

MENENIUS

What should I do?

BRUTUS

Only make trial what your love can doFor Rome, towards Marcius.

MENENIUS

Well, and say that MarciusReturn me, as Cominius is return'd,Unheard; what then?But as a discontented friend, grief-shotWith his unkindness? say't be so?

SICINIUS

Yet your good willmust have that thanks from Rome, after the measureAs you intended well.

MENENIUS

I'll undertake 't:I think he'll hear me. Yet, to bite his lipAnd hum at good Cominius, much unhearts me.He was not taken well; he had not dined:The veins unfill'd, our blood is cold, and thenWe pout upon the morning, are unaptTo give or to forgive; but when we have stuff'dThese and these conveyances of our bloodWith wine and feeding, we have suppler soulsThan in our priest-like fasts: therefore I'll watch himTill he be dieted to my request,And then I'll set upon him.

BRUTUS

You know the very road into his kindness,And cannot lose your way.

MENENIUS

Good faith, I'll prove him,Speed how it will. I shall ere long have knowledgeOf my success.Exit


COMINIUS

                  He'll never hear him.

SICINIUS

Not?

COMINIUS

I tell you, he does sit in gold, his eyeRed as 'twould burn Rome; and his injuryThe gaoler to his pity. I kneel'd before him;'Twas very faintly he said 'Rise;' dismiss'd meThus, with his speechless hand: what he would do,He sent in writing after me; what he would not,Bound with an oath to yield to his conditions:So that all hope is vain.Unless his noble mother, and his wife;Who, as I hear, mean to solicit himFor mercy to his country. Therefore, let's hence,And with our fair entreaties haste them on.Exeunt

SCENE II. Entrance of the Volscian camp before Rome.

Two Sentinels on guard.Enter to them, MENENIUS


First Senator

Stay: whence are you?

Second Senator

Stand, and go back.

MENENIUS

You guard like men; 'tis well: but, by your leave,I am an officer of state, and comeTo speak with Coriolanus.

First Senator

From whence?

MENENIUS

From Rome.

First Senator

You may not pass, you must return: our generalWill no more hear from thence.

Second Senator

You'll see your Rome embraced with fire beforeYou'll speak with Coriolanus.

MENENIUS

Good my friends,If you have heard your general talk of Rome,And of his friends there, it is lots to blanks,My name hath touch'd your ears it is Menenius.

First Senator

Be it so; go back: the virtue of your nameIs not here passable.

MENENIUS

I tell thee, fellow,The general is my lover: I have beenThe book of his good acts, whence men have readHis name unparallel'd, haply amplified;For I have ever verified my friends,Of whom he's chief, with all the size that verityWould without lapsing suffer: nay, sometimes,Like to a bowl upon a subtle ground,I have tumbled past the throw; and in his praiseHave almost stamp'd the leasing: therefore, fellow,I must have leave to pass.

First Senator

Faith, sir, if you had told as many lies in hisbehalf as you have uttered words in your own, youshould not pass here; no, though it were as virtuousto lie as to live chastely. Therefore, go back.

MENENIUS

Prithee, fellow, remember my name is Menenius,always factionary on the party of your general.

Second Senator

Howsoever you have been his liar, as you say youhave, I am one that, telling true under him, mustsay, you cannot pass. Therefore, go back.

MENENIUS

Has he dined, canst thou tell? for I would notspeak with him till after dinner.

First Senator

You are a Roman, are you?

MENENIUS

I am, as thy general is.

First Senator

Then you should hate Rome, as he does. Can you,when you have pushed out your gates the verydefender of them, and, in a violent popularignorance, given your enemy your shield, think tofront his revenges with the easy groans of oldwomen, the virginal palms of your daughters, or withthe palsied intercession of such a decayed dotant asyou seem to be? Can you think to blow out theintended fire your city is ready to flame in, withsuch weak breath as this? No, you are deceived;therefore, back to Rome, and prepare for yourexecution: you are condemned, our general has swornyou out of reprieve and pardon.

MENENIUS

Sirrah, if thy captain knew I were here, he woulduse me with estimation.

Second Senator

Come, my captain knows you not.

MENENIUS

I mean, thy general.

First Senator

My general cares not for you. Back, I say, go; lestI let forth your half-pint of blood; back,--that'sthe utmost of your having: back.

MENENIUS

Nay, but, fellow, fellow,--Enter CORIOLANUS and AUFIDIUS


CORIOLANUS

What's the matter?

MENENIUS

Now, you companion, I'll say an errand for you:You shall know now that I am in estimation; you shallperceive that a Jack guardant cannot office me frommy son Coriolanus: guess, but by my entertainmentwith him, if thou standest not i' the state ofhanging, or of some death more long inspectatorship, and crueller in suffering; behold nowpresently, and swoon for what's to come upon thee.To CORIOLANUS
The glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thyparticular prosperity, and love thee no worse thanthy old father Menenius does! O my son, my son!thou art preparing fire for us; look thee, here'swater to quench it. I was hardly moved to come tothee; but being assured none but myself could movethee, I have been blown out of your gates withsighs; and conjure thee to pardon Rome, and thypetitionary countrymen. The good gods assuage thywrath, and turn the dregs of it upon this varlethere,--this, who, like a block, hath denied myaccess to thee.

CORIOLANUS

Away!

MENENIUS

How! away!

CORIOLANUS

Wife, mother, child, I know not. My affairsAre servanted to others: though I oweMy revenge properly, my remission liesIn Volscian breasts. That we have been familiar,Ingrate forgetfulness shall poison, ratherThan pity note how much. Therefore, be gone.Mine ears against your suits are stronger thanYour gates against my force. Yet, for I loved thee,Take this along; I writ it for thy sakeGives a letter
And would have rent it. Another word, Menenius,I will not hear thee speak. This man, Aufidius,Was my beloved in Rome: yet thou behold'st!

AUFIDIUS

You keep a constant temper.Exeunt CORIOLANUS and AUFIDIUS


First Senator

Now, sir, is your name Menenius?

Second Senator

'Tis a spell, you see, of much  power: you know theway home again.

First Senator

Do you hear how we are shent for keeping yourgreatness back?

Second Senator

What cause, do you think, I have to swoon?

MENENIUS

I neither care for the world nor your general: forsuch things as you, I can scarce think there's any,ye're so slight. He that hath a will to die byhimself fears it not from another: let your generaldo his worst. For you, be that you are, long; andyour misery increase with your age! I say to you,as I was said to, Away!Exit


First Senator

A noble fellow, I warrant him.

Second Senator

The worthy fellow is our general: he's the rock, theoak not to be wind-shaken.Exeunt

CORIOLANUS

We will before the walls of Rome tomorrowSet down our host. My partner in this action,You must report to the Volscian lords, how plainlyI have borne this business.

AUFIDIUS

Only their endsYou have respected; stopp'd your ears againstThe general suit of Rome; never admittedA private whisper, no, not with such friendsThat thought them sure of you.

CORIOLANUS

This last old man,Whom with a crack'd heart I have sent to Rome,Loved me above the measure of a father;Nay, godded me, indeed. Their latest refugeWas to send him; for whose old love I have,Though I show'd sourly to him, once more offer'dThe first conditions, which they did refuseAnd cannot now accept; to grace him onlyThat thought he could do more, a very littleI have yielded to: fresh embassies and suits,Nor from the state nor private friends, hereafterWill I lend ear to.

My mother bows;As if Olympus to a molehill shouldIn supplication nod: and my young boyHath an aspect of intercession, whichGreat nature cries 'Deny not.' let the VolscesPlough Rome and harrow Italy: I'll neverBe such a gosling to obey instinct, but stand,As if a man were author of himselfAnd knew no other kin.

VIRGILIA

My lord and husband!

CORIOLANUS

These eyes are not the same I wore in Rome.

VIRGILIA

The sorrow that delivers us thus changedMakes you think so.

CORIOLANUS

Like a dull actor now,I have forgot my part, and I am out,Even to a full disgrace. Best of my flesh,Forgive my tyranny; but do not sayFor that 'Forgive our Romans.' O, a kissLong as my exile, sweet as my revenge!Now, by the jealous queen of heaven, that kissI carried from thee, dear; and my true lipHath virgin'd it e'er since. You gods! I prate,And the most noble mother of the worldLeave unsaluted: sink, my knee, i' the earth;Kneels
Of thy deep duty more impression showThan that of common sons.

VOLUMNIA

O, stand up blest!Whilst, with no softer cushion than the flint,I kneel before thee; and unproperlyShow duty, as mistaken all this whileBetween the child and parent.Kneels


CORIOLANUS

What is this?Your knees to me? to your corrected son?Then let the pebbles on the hungry beachFillip the stars; then let the mutinous windsStrike the proud cedars 'gainst the fiery sun;Murdering impossibility, to makeWhat cannot be, slight work.

VOLUMNIA

Thou art my warrior;I holp to frame thee. Do you know this lady?

CORIOLANUS

The noble sister of Publicola,The moon of Rome, chaste as the icicleThat's curdied by the frost from purest snowAnd hangs on Dian's temple: dear Valeria!

VOLUMNIA

This is a poor epitome of yours,Which by the interpretation of full timeMay show like all yourself.

CORIOLANUS

The god of soldiers,With the consent of supreme Jove, informThy thoughts with nobleness; that thou mayst proveTo shame unvulnerable, and stick i' the warsLike a great sea-mark, standing every flaw,And saving those that eye thee!

VOLUMNIA

Your knee, sirrah.

CORIOLANUS

That's my brave boy!

VOLUMNIA

Even he, your wife, this lady, and myself,Are suitors to you.

CORIOLANUS

I beseech you, peace:Or, if you'ld ask, remember this before:The thing I have forsworn to grant may neverBe held by you denials. Do not bid meDismiss my soldiers, or capitulateAgain with Rome's mechanics: tell me notWherein I seem unnatural: desire notTo ally my rages and revenges withYour colder reasons.

VOLUMNIA

O, no more, no more!You have said you will not grant us any thing;For we have nothing else to ask, but thatWhich you deny already: yet we will ask;That, if you fail in our request, the blameMay hang upon your hardness: therefore hear us.

CORIOLANUS

Aufidius, and you Volsces, mark; for we'llHear nought from Rome in private. Your request?

VOLUMNIA

Should we be silent and not speak, our raimentAnd state of bodies would bewray what lifeWe have led since thy exile. Think with thyselfHow more unfortunate than all living womenAre we come hither: since that thy sight,which shouldMake our eyes flow with joy, hearts dancewith comforts,Constrains them weep and shake with fear and sorrow;Making the mother, wife and child to seeThe son, the husband and the father tearingHis country's bowels out. And to poor weThine enmity's most capital: thou barr'st usOur prayers to the gods, which is a comfortThat all but we enjoy; for how can we,Alas, how can we for our country pray.Whereto we are bound, together with thy victory,Whereto we are bound? alack, or we must loseThe country, our dear nurse, or else thy person,Our comfort in the country. We must findAn evident calamity, though we hadOur wish, which side should win: for either thouMust, as a foreign recreant, be ledWith manacles thorough our streets, or elsetriumphantly tread on thy country's ruin,And bear the palm for having bravely shedThy wife and children's blood. For myself, son,I purpose not to wait on fortune tillThese wars determine: if I cannot persuade theeRather to show a noble grace to both partsThan seek the end of one, thou shalt no soonerMarch to assault thy country than to tread--Trust to't, thou shalt not--on thy mother's womb,That brought thee to this world.

VIRGILIA

Ay, and mine,That brought you forth this boy, to keep your nameLiving to time.

Young MARCIUS

A' shall not tread on me;I'll run away till I am bigger, but then I'll fight.

CORIOLANUS

Not of a woman's tenderness to be,Requires nor child nor woman's face to see.I have sat too long.Rising


VOLUMNIA

Nay, go not from us thus.If it were so that our request did tendTo save the Romans, thereby to destroyThe Volsces whom you serve, you might condemn us,As poisonous of your honour: no; our suitIs that you reconcile them: while the VolscesMay say 'This mercy we have show'd;' the Romans,'This we received;' and each in either sideGive the all-hail to thee and cry 'Be blestFor making up this peace!' Thou know'st, great son,The end of war's uncertain, but this certain,That, if thou conquer Rome, the benefitWhich thou shalt thereby reap is such a name,Whose repetition will be dogg'd with curses;Whose chronicle thus writ: 'The man was noble,But with his last attempt he wiped it out;Destroy'd his country, and his name remainsTo the ensuing age abhorr'd.' Speak to me, son:Thou hast affected the fine strains of honour,To imitate the graces of the gods;To tear with thunder the wide cheeks o' the air,And yet to charge thy sulphur with a boltThat should but rive an oak. Why dost not speak?Think'st thou it honourable for a noble manStill to remember wrongs? Daughter, speak you:He cares not for your weeping. Speak thou, boy:Perhaps thy childishness will move him moreThan can our reasons. There's no man in the worldMore bound to 's mother; yet here he lets me prateLike one i' the stocks. Thou hast never in thy lifeShow'd thy dear mother any courtesy,When she, poor hen, fond of no second brood,Has cluck'd thee to the wars and safely home,Loaden with honour. Say my request's unjust,And spurn me back: but if it be not so,Thou art not honest; and the gods will plague thee,That thou restrain'st from me the duty whichTo a mother's part belongs. He turns away:Down, ladies; let us shame him with our knees.To his surname Coriolanus 'longs more prideThan pity to our prayers. Down: an end;This is the last: so we will home to Rome,And die among our neighbours. Nay, behold 's:This boy, that cannot tell what he would haveBut kneels and holds up bands for fellowship,Does reason our petition with more strengthThan thou hast to deny 't. Come, let us go:This fellow had a Volscian to his mother;His wife is in Corioli and his childLike him by chance. Yet give us our dispatch:I am hush'd until our city be a-fire,And then I'll speak a little.He holds her by the hand, silent


CORIOLANUS

O mother, mother!What have you done? Behold, the heavens do ope,The gods look down, and this unnatural sceneThey laugh at. O my mother, mother! O!You have won a happy victory to Rome;But, for your son,--believe it, O, believe it,Most dangerously you have with him prevail'd,If not most mortal to him. But, let it come.Aufidius, though I cannot make true wars,I'll frame convenient peace. Now, good Aufidius,Were you in my stead, would you have heardA mother less? or granted less, Aufidius?

AUFIDIUS

I was moved withal.

CORIOLANUS

I dare be sworn you were:And, sir, it is no little thing to makeMine eyes to sweat compassion. But, good sir,What peace you'll make, advise me: for my part,I'll not to Rome, I'll back with you; and pray you,Stand to me in this cause. O mother! wife!

AUFIDIUS

[Aside]  I am glad thou hast set thy mercy andthy honourAt difference in thee: out of that I'll workMyself a former fortune.The Ladies make signs to CORIOLANUS


CORIOLANUS

Ay, by and by;To VOLUMNIA, VIRGILIA,  & c
But we will drink together; and you shall bearA better witness back than words, which we,On like conditions, will have counter-seal'd.Come, enter with us. Ladies, you deserveTo have a temple built you: all the swordsIn Italy, and her confederate arms,Could not have made this peace.Exeunt

SCENE IV. Rome. A public place.

Enter MENENIUS and SICINIUS


MENENIUS

See you yond coign o' the Capitol, yondcorner-stone?

SICINIUS

Why, what of that?

MENENIUS

If it be possible for you to displace it with yourlittle finger, there is some hope the ladies ofRome, especially his mother, may prevail with him.But I say there is no hope in't: our throats aresentenced and stay upon execution.

SICINIUS

Is't possible that so short a time can alter thecondition of a man!

MENENIUS

There is differency between a grub and a butterfly;yet your butterfly was a grub. This Marcius is grownfrom man to dragon: he has wings; he's more than acreeping thing.

SICINIUS

He loved his mother dearly.

MENENIUS

So did he me: and he no more remembers his mothernow than an eight-year-old horse. The tartnessof his face sours ripe grapes: when he walks, hemoves like an engine, and the ground shrinks beforehis treading: he is able to pierce a corslet withhis eye; talks like a knell, and his hum is abattery. He sits in his state, as a thing made forAlexander. What he bids be done is finished withhis bidding. He wants nothing of a god but eternityand a heaven to throne in.

SICINIUS

Yes, mercy, if you report him truly.

MENENIUS

I paint him in the character. Mark what mercy hismother shall bring from him: there is no more mercyin him than there is milk in a male tiger; thatshall our poor city find: and all this is long ofyou.

SICINIUS

The gods be good unto us!

MENENIUS

No, in such a case the gods will not be good untous. When we banished him, we respected not them;and, he returning to break our necks, they respect not us.Enter a Messenger


Messenger

Sir, if you'ld save your life, fly to your house:The plebeians have got your fellow-tribuneAnd hale him up and down, all swearing, ifThe Roman ladies bring not comfort home,They'll give him death by inches.Enter a second Messenger


SICINIUS

What's the news?

Second Messenger

Good news, good news; the ladies have prevail'd,The Volscians are dislodged, and Marcius gone:A merrier day did never yet greet Rome,No, not the expulsion of the Tarquins.

SICINIUS

Friend,Art thou certain this is true? is it most certain?

Second Messenger

As certain as I know the sun is fire:Where have you lurk'd, that you make doubt of it?Ne'er through an arch so hurried the blown tide,As the recomforted through the gates. Why, hark you!Trumpets; hautboys; drums beat; all together
The trumpets, sackbuts, psalteries and fifes,Tabours and cymbals and the shouting Romans,Make the sun dance. Hark you!A shout within


MENENIUS

This is good news:I will go meet the ladies. This VolumniaIs worth of consuls, senators, patricians,A city full; of tribunes, such as you,A sea and land full. You have pray'd well to-day:This morning for ten thousand of your throatsI'd not have given a doit. Hark, how they joy!Music still, with shouts


SICINIUS

First, the gods bless you for your tidings; next,Accept my thankfulness.

Second Messenger

Sir, we have allGreat cause to give great thanks.

SICINIUS

They are near the city?

Second Messenger

Almost at point to enter.

SICINIUS

We will meet them,And help the joy.Exeunt

SCENE V. The same. A street near the gate.

Enter two Senators with VOLUMNIA, VIRGILIA,  VALERIA,  & c. passing over the stage, followed by Patricians and others


First Senator

Behold our patroness, the life of Rome!Call all your tribes together, praise the gods,And make triumphant fires; strew flowers before them:Unshout the noise that banish'd Marcius,Repeal him with the welcome of his mother;Cry 'Welcome, ladies, welcome!'

All

Welcome, ladies, Welcome!A flourish with drums and trumpets. Exeunt

SCENE VI. Antium. A public place.

Enter TULLUS AUFIDIUS, with Attendants


AUFIDIUS

Go tell the lords o' the city I am here:Deliver them this paper: having read it,Bid them repair to the market place; where I,Even in theirs and in the commons' ears,Will vouch the truth of it. Him I accuseThe city ports by this hath enter'd andIntends to appear before the people, hopingTo purge herself with words: dispatch.Exeunt Attendants
Enter three or four Conspirators of AUFIDIUS' faction
Most welcome!

First Conspirator

How is it with our general?

AUFIDIUS

Even soAs with a man by his own alms empoison'd,And with his charity slain.

Second Conspirator

Most noble sir,If you do hold the same intent whereinYou wish'd us parties, we'll deliver youOf your great danger.

AUFIDIUS

Sir, I cannot tell:We must proceed as we do find the people.

Third Conspirator

The people will remain uncertain whilst'Twixt you there's difference; but the fall of eitherMakes the survivor heir of all.

AUFIDIUS

I know it;And my pretext to strike at him admitsA good construction. I raised him, and I pawn'dMine honour for his truth: who being so heighten'd,He water'd his new plants with dews of flattery,Seducing so my friends; and, to this end,He bow'd his nature, never known beforeBut to be rough, unswayable and free.

Third Conspirator

Sir, his stoutnessWhen he did stand for consul, which he lostBy lack of stooping,--

AUFIDIUS

That I would have spoke of:Being banish'd for't, he came unto my hearth;Presented to my knife his throat: I took him;Made him joint-servant with me; gave him wayIn all his own desires; nay, let him chooseOut of my files, his projects to accomplish,My best and freshest men; served his designmentsIn mine own person; holp to reap the fameWhich he did end all his; and took some prideTo do myself this wrong: till, at the last,I seem'd his follower, not partner, andHe waged me with his countenance, as ifI had been mercenary.

First Conspirator

So he did, my lord:The army marvell'd at it, and, in the last,When he had carried Rome and that we look'dFor no less spoil than glory,--

AUFIDIUS

There was it:For which my sinews shall be stretch'd upon him.At a few drops of women's rheum, which areAs cheap as lies, he sold the blood and labourOf our great action: therefore shall he die,And I'll renew me in his fall. But, hark!Drums and trumpets sound, with great shouts of the People


First Conspirator

Your native town you enter'd like a post,And had no welcomes home: but he returns,Splitting the air with noise.

Second Conspirator

And patient fools,Whose children he hath slain, their base throats tearWith giving him glory.

Third Conspirator

Therefore, at your vantage,Ere he express himself, or move the peopleWith what he would say, let him feel your sword,Which we will second. When he lies along,After your way his tale pronounced shall buryHis reasons with his body.

AUFIDIUS

Say no more:Here come the lords.Enter the Lords of the city


All The Lords

You are most welcome home.

AUFIDIUS

I have not deserved it.But, worthy lords, have you with heed perusedWhat I have written to you?

Lords

We have.

First Lord

And grieve to hear't.What faults he made before the last, I thinkMight have found easy fines: but there to endWhere he was to begin and give awayThe benefit of our levies, answering usWith our own charge, making a treaty whereThere was a yielding,--this admits no excuse.

AUFIDIUS

He approaches: you shall hear him.Enter CORIOLANUS, marching with drum and colours; commoners being with him


CORIOLANUS

Hail, lords! I am return'd your soldier,No more infected with my country's loveThan when I parted hence, but still subsistingUnder your great command. You are to knowThat prosperously I have attempted andWith bloody passage led your wars even toThe gates of Rome. Our spoils we have brought homeDo more than counterpoise a full third partThe charges of the action. We have made peaceWith no less honour to the AntiatesThan shame to the Romans: and we here deliver,Subscribed by the consuls and patricians,Together with the seal o' the senate, whatWe have compounded on.

AUFIDIUS

Read it not, noble lords;But tell the traitor, in the high'st degreeHe hath abused your powers.

CORIOLANUS

Traitor! how now!

AUFIDIUS

                  Ay, traitor, Marcius!

CORIOLANUS

Marcius!

AUFIDIUS

Ay, Marcius, Caius Marcius: dost thou thinkI'll grace thee with that robbery, thy stol'n nameCoriolanus in Corioli?You lords and heads o' the state, perfidiouslyHe has betray'd your business, and given up,For certain drops of salt, your city Rome,I say 'your city,' to his wife and mother;Breaking his oath and resolution likeA twist of rotten silk, never admittingCounsel o' the war, but at his nurse's tearsHe whined and roar'd away your victory,That pages blush'd at him and men of heartLook'd wondering each at other.

CORIOLANUS

Hear'st thou, Mars?

AUFIDIUS

Name not the god, thou boy of tears!

CORIOLANUS

Ha!

AUFIDIUS

No more.

CORIOLANUS

Measureless liar, thou hast made my heartToo great for what contains it. Boy! O slave!Pardon me, lords, 'tis the first time that everI was forced to scold. Your judgments, my grave lords,Must give this cur the lie: and his own notion--Who wears my stripes impress'd upon him; thatMust bear my beating to his grave--shall joinTo thrust the lie unto him.

First Lord

Peace, both, and hear me speak.

CORIOLANUS

Cut me to pieces, Volsces; men and lads,Stain all your edges on me. Boy! false hound!If you have writ your annals true, 'tis there,That, like an eagle in a dove-cote, IFlutter'd your Volscians in Corioli:Alone I did it. Boy!

AUFIDIUS

Why, noble lords,Will you be put in mind of his blind fortune,Which was your shame, by this unholy braggart,'Fore your own eyes and ears?

All Conspirators

Let him die for't.

All The People

'Tear him to pieces.' 'Do it presently.' 'He kill'dmy son.' 'My daughter.' 'He killed my cousinMarcus.' 'He killed my father.'

Second Lord

Peace, ho! no outrage: peace!The man is noble and his fame folds-inThis orb o' the earth. His last offences to usShall have judicious hearing. Stand, Aufidius,And trouble not the peace.

CORIOLANUS

O that I had him,With six Aufidiuses, or more, his tribe,To use my lawful sword!

AUFIDIUS

Insolent villain!

All Conspirators

Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill him!The Conspirators draw, and kill CORIOLANUS: AUFIDIUS stands on his body


Lords

Hold, hold, hold, hold!

AUFIDIUS

My noble masters, hear me speak.

First Lord

O Tullus,--

Second Lord

Thou hast done a deed whereat valour will weep.

Third Lord

Tread not upon him. Masters all, be quiet;Put up your swords.

AUFIDIUS

My lords, when you shall know--as in this rage,Provoked by him, you cannot--the great dangerWhich this man's life did owe you, you'll rejoiceThat he is thus cut off. Please it your honoursTo call me to your senate, I'll deliverMyself your loyal servant, or endureYour heaviest censure.

First Lord

Bear from hence his body;And mourn you for him: let him be regardedAs the most noble corse that ever heraldDid follow to his urn.

Second Lord

His own impatienceTakes from Aufidius a great part of blame.Let's make the best of it.

AUFIDIUS

My rage is gone;And I am struck with sorrow. Take him up.Help, three o' the chiefest soldiers; I'll be one.Beat thou the drum, that it speak mournfully:Trail your steel pikes. Though in this city heHath widow'd and unchilded many a one,Which to this hour bewail the injury,Yet he shall have a noble memory. Assist.Exeunt, bearing the body of CORIOLANUS. A dead march sounded
