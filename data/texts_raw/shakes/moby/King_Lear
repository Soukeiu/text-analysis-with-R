SCENE I. King Lear's palace.

Enter KENT, GLOUCESTER, and EDMUND


KENT

I thought the king had more affected the Duke ofAlbany than Cornwall.

GLOUCESTER

It did always seem so to us: but now, in thedivision of the kingdom, it appears not which ofthe dukes he values most; for equalities are soweighed, that curiosity in neither can make choiceof either's moiety.

KENT

Is not this your son, my lord?

GLOUCESTER

His breeding, sir, hath been at my charge: I haveso often blushed to acknowledge him, that now I ambrazed to it.

KENT

I cannot conceive you.

GLOUCESTER

Sir, this young fellow's mother could: whereuponshe grew round-wombed, and had, indeed, sir, a sonfor her cradle ere she had a husband for her bed.Do you smell a fault?

KENT

I cannot wish the fault undone, the issue of itbeing so proper.

GLOUCESTER

But I have, sir, a son by order of law, some yearelder than this, who yet is no dearer in my account:though this knave came something saucily into theworld before he was sent for, yet was his motherfair; there was good sport at his making, and thewhoreson must be acknowledged. Do you know thisnoble gentleman, Edmund?

EDMUND

No, my lord.

GLOUCESTER

My lord of Kent: remember him hereafter as myhonourable friend.

EDMUND

My services to your lordship.

KENT

I must love you, and sue to know you better.

EDMUND

Sir, I shall study deserving.

GLOUCESTER

He hath been out nine years, and away he shallagain. The king is coming.Sennet. Enter KING LEAR, CORNWALL, ALBANY, GONERIL, REGAN, CORDELIA, and Attendants


KING LEAR

Attend the lords of France and Burgundy, Gloucester.

GLOUCESTER

I shall, my liege.Exeunt GLOUCESTER and EDMUND


KING LEAR

Meantime we shall express our darker purpose.Give me the map there. Know that we have dividedIn three our kingdom: and 'tis our fast intentTo shake all cares and business from our age;Conferring them on younger strengths, while weUnburthen'd crawl toward death. Our son of Cornwall,And you, our no less loving son of Albany,We have this hour a constant will to publishOur daughters' several dowers, that future strifeMay be prevented now. The princes, France and Burgundy,Great rivals in our youngest daughter's love,Long in our court have made their amorous sojourn,And here are to be answer'd. Tell me, my daughters,--Since now we will divest us both of rule,Interest of territory, cares of state,--Which of you shall we say doth love us most?That we our largest bounty may extendWhere nature doth with merit challenge. Goneril,Our eldest-born, speak first.

GONERIL

Sir, I love you more than words can wield the matter;Dearer than eye-sight, space, and liberty;Beyond what can be valued, rich or rare;No less than life, with grace, health, beauty, honour;As much as child e'er loved, or father found;A love that makes breath poor, and speech unable;Beyond all manner of so much I love you.

CORDELIA

[Aside]  What shall Cordelia do?Love, and be silent.

LEAR

Of all these bounds, even from this line to this,With shadowy forests and with champains rich'd,With plenteous rivers and wide-skirted meads,We make thee lady: to thine and Albany's issueBe this perpetual. What says our second daughter,Our dearest Regan, wife to Cornwall? Speak.

REGAN

Sir, I am madeOf the self-same metal that my sister is,And prize me at her worth. In my true heartI find she names my very deed of love;Only she comes too short: that I professMyself an enemy to all other joys,Which the most precious square of sense possesses;And find I am alone felicitateIn your dear highness' love.

CORDELIA

[Aside]	Then poor Cordelia!And yet not so; since, I am sure, my love'sMore richer than my tongue.

KING LEAR

To thee and thine hereditary everRemain this ample third of our fair kingdom;No less in space, validity, and pleasure,Than that conferr'd on Goneril. Now, our joy,Although the last, not least; to whose young loveThe vines of France and milk of BurgundyStrive to be interess'd; what can you say to drawA third more opulent than your sisters? Speak.

CORDELIA

Nothing, my lord.

KING LEAR

Nothing!

CORDELIA

Nothing.

KING LEAR

Nothing will come of nothing: speak again.

CORDELIA

Unhappy that I am, I cannot heaveMy heart into my mouth: I love your majestyAccording to my bond; nor more nor less.

KING LEAR

How, how, Cordelia! mend your speech a little,Lest it may mar your fortunes.

CORDELIA

Good my lord,You have begot me, bred me, loved me: IReturn those duties back as are right fit,Obey you, love you, and most honour you.Why have my sisters husbands, if they sayThey love you all? Haply, when I shall wed,That lord whose hand must take my plight shall carryHalf my love with him, half my care and duty:Sure, I shall never marry like my sisters,To love my father all.

KING LEAR

But goes thy heart with this?

CORDELIA

Ay, good my lord.

KING LEAR

So young, and so untender?

CORDELIA

So young, my lord, and true.

KING LEAR

Let it be so; thy truth, then, be thy dower:For, by the sacred radiance of the sun,The mysteries of Hecate, and the night;By all the operation of the orbsFrom whom we do exist, and cease to be;Here I disclaim all my paternal care,Propinquity and property of blood,And as a stranger to my heart and meHold thee, from this, for ever. The barbarous Scythian,Or he that makes his generation messesTo gorge his appetite, shall to my bosomBe as well neighbour'd, pitied, and relieved,As thou my sometime daughter.

KENT

Good my liege,--

KING LEAR

Peace, Kent!Come not between the dragon and his wrath.I loved her most, and thought to set my restOn her kind nursery. Hence, and avoid my sight!So be my grave my peace, as here I giveHer father's heart from her! Call France; who stirs?Call Burgundy. Cornwall and Albany,With my two daughters' dowers digest this third:Let pride, which she calls plainness, marry her.I do invest you jointly with my power,Pre-eminence, and all the large effectsThat troop with majesty. Ourself, by monthly course,With reservation of an hundred knights,By you to be sustain'd, shall our abodeMake with you by due turns. Only we still retainThe name, and all the additions to a king;The sway, revenue, execution of the rest,Beloved sons, be yours: which to confirm,This coronet part betwixt you.Giving the crown


KENT

Royal Lear,Whom I have ever honour'd as my king,Loved as my father, as my master follow'd,As my great patron thought on in my prayers,--

KING LEAR

The bow is bent and drawn, make from the shaft.

KENT

Let it fall rather, though the fork invadeThe region of my heart: be Kent unmannerly,When Lear is mad. What wilt thou do, old man?Think'st thou that duty shall have dread to speak,When power to flattery bows? To plainness honour's bound,When majesty stoops to folly. Reverse thy doom;And, in thy best consideration, chequeThis hideous rashness: answer my life my judgment,Thy youngest daughter does not love thee least;Nor are those empty-hearted whose low soundReverbs no hollowness.

KING LEAR

Kent, on thy life, no more.

KENT

My life I never held but as a pawnTo wage against thy enemies; nor fear to lose it,Thy safety being the motive.

KING LEAR

Out of my sight!

KENT

See better, Lear; and let me still remainThe true blank of thine eye.

KING LEAR

Now, by Apollo,--

KENT

                  Now, by Apollo, king,Thou swear'st thy gods in vain.

KING LEAR

O, vassal! miscreant!Laying his hand on his sword


ALBANY

CORNWALL

Dear sir, forbear.

KENT

Do:Kill thy physician, and the fee bestowUpon thy foul disease. Revoke thy doom;Or, whilst I can vent clamour from my throat,I'll tell thee thou dost evil.

KING LEAR

Hear me, recreant!On thine allegiance, hear me!Since thou hast sought to make us break our vow,Which we durst never yet, and with strain'd prideTo come between our sentence and our power,Which nor our nature nor our place can bear,Our potency made good, take thy reward.Five days we do allot thee, for provisionTo shield thee from diseases of the world;And on the sixth to turn thy hated backUpon our kingdom: if, on the tenth day following,Thy banish'd trunk be found in our dominions,The moment is thy death. Away! by Jupiter,This shall not be revoked.

KENT

Fare thee well, king: sith thus thou wilt appear,Freedom lives hence, and banishment is here.To CORDELIA
The gods to their dear shelter take thee, maid,That justly think'st, and hast most rightly said!To REGAN and GONERIL
And your large speeches may your deeds approve,That good effects may spring from words of love.Thus Kent, O princes, bids you all adieu;He'll shape his old course in a country new.Exit
Flourish. Re-enter GLOUCESTER, with KING OF FRANCE, BURGUNDY, and Attendants


GLOUCESTER

Here's France and Burgundy, my noble lord.

KING LEAR

My lord of Burgundy.We first address towards you, who with this kingHath rivall'd for our daughter: what, in the least,Will you require in present dower with her,Or cease your quest of love?

BURGUNDY

Most royal majesty,I crave no more than what your highness offer'd,Nor will you tender less.

KING LEAR

Right noble Burgundy,When she was dear to us, we did hold her so;But now her price is fall'n. Sir, there she stands:If aught within that little seeming substance,Or all of it, with our displeasure pieced,And nothing more, may fitly like your grace,She's there, and she is yours.

BURGUNDY

I know no answer.

KING LEAR

Will you, with those infirmities she owes,Unfriended, new-adopted to our hate,Dower'd with our curse, and stranger'd with our oath,Take her, or leave her?

BURGUNDY

Pardon me, royal sir;Election makes not up on such conditions.

KING LEAR

Then leave her, sir; for, by the power that made me,I tell you all her wealth.To KING OF FRANCE
For you, great king,I would not from your love make such a stray,To match you where I hate; therefore beseech youTo avert your liking a more worthier wayThan on a wretch whom nature is ashamedAlmost to acknowledge hers.

KING OF FRANCE

This is most strange,That she, that even but now was your best object,The argument of your praise, balm of your age,Most best, most dearest, should in this trice of timeCommit a thing so monstrous, to dismantleSo many folds of favour. Sure, her offenceMust be of such unnatural degree,That monsters it, or your fore-vouch'd affectionFall'n into taint: which to believe of her,Must be a faith that reason without miracleCould never plant in me.

CORDELIA

I yet beseech your majesty,--If for I want that glib and oily art,To speak and purpose not; since what I well intend,I'll do't before I speak,--that you make knownIt is no vicious blot, murder, or foulness,No unchaste action, or dishonour'd step,That hath deprived me of your grace and favour;But even for want of that for which I am richer,A still-soliciting eye, and such a tongueAs I am glad I have not, though not to have itHath lost me in your liking.

KING LEAR

Better thouHadst not been born than not to have pleased me better.

KING OF FRANCE

Is it but this,--a tardiness in natureWhich often leaves the history unspokeThat it intends to do? My lord of Burgundy,What say you to the lady? Love's not loveWhen it is mingled with regards that standAloof from the entire point. Will you have her?She is herself a dowry.

BURGUNDY

Royal Lear,Give but that portion which yourself proposed,And here I take Cordelia by the hand,Duchess of Burgundy.

KING LEAR

Nothing: I have sworn; I am firm.

BURGUNDY

I am sorry, then, you have so lost a fatherThat you must lose a husband.

CORDELIA

Peace be with Burgundy!Since that respects of fortune are his love,I shall not be his wife.

KING OF FRANCE

Fairest Cordelia, that art most rich, being poor;Most choice, forsaken; and most loved, despised!Thee and thy virtues here I seize upon:Be it lawful I take up what's cast away.Gods, gods! 'tis strange that from their cold'st neglectMy love should kindle to inflamed respect.Thy dowerless daughter, king, thrown to my chance,Is queen of us, of ours, and our fair France:Not all the dukes of waterish BurgundyCan buy this unprized precious maid of me.Bid them farewell, Cordelia, though unkind:Thou losest here, a better where to find.

KING LEAR

Thou hast her, France: let her be thine; for weHave no such daughter, nor shall ever seeThat face of hers again. Therefore be goneWithout our grace, our love, our benison.Come, noble Burgundy.Flourish. Exeunt all but KING OF FRANCE, GONERIL, REGAN, and CORDELIA


KING OF FRANCE

Bid farewell to your sisters.

CORDELIA

The jewels of our father, with wash'd eyesCordelia leaves you: I know you what you are;And like a sister am most loath to callYour faults as they are named. Use well our father:To your professed bosoms I commit himBut yet, alas, stood I within his grace,I would prefer him to a better place.So, farewell to you both.

REGAN

Prescribe not us our duties.

GONERIL

Let your studyBe to content your lord, who hath received youAt fortune's alms. You have obedience scanted,And well are worth the want that you have wanted.

CORDELIA

Time shall unfold what plaited cunning hides:Who cover faults, at last shame them derides.Well may you prosper!

KING OF FRANCE

Come, my fair Cordelia.Exeunt KING OF FRANCE and CORDELIA


GONERIL

Sister, it is not a little I have to say of whatmost nearly appertains to us both. I think ourfather will hence to-night.

REGAN

That's most certain, and with you; next month with us.

GONERIL

You see how full of changes his age is; theobservation we have made of it hath not beenlittle: he always loved our sister most; andwith what poor judgment he hath now cast her offappears too grossly.

REGAN

'Tis the infirmity of his age: yet he hath everbut slenderly known himself.

GONERIL

The best and soundest of his time hath been butrash; then must we look to receive from his age,not alone the imperfections of long-engraffedcondition, but therewithal the unruly waywardnessthat infirm and choleric years bring with them.

REGAN

Such unconstant starts are we like to have fromhim as this of Kent's banishment.

GONERIL

There is further compliment of leavetakingbetween France and him. Pray you, let's hittogether: if our father carry authority withsuch dispositions as he bears, this lastsurrender of his will but offend us.

REGAN

We shall further think on't.

GONERIL

We must do something, and i' the heat.Exeunt

SCENE II. The Earl of Gloucester's castle.

Enter EDMUND, with a letter


EDMUND

Thou, nature, art my goddess; to thy lawMy services are bound. Wherefore should IStand in the plague of custom, and permitThe curiosity of nations to deprive me,For that I am some twelve or fourteen moon-shinesLag of a brother? Why bastard? wherefore base?When my dimensions are as well compact,My mind as generous, and my shape as true,As honest madam's issue? Why brand they usWith base? with baseness? bastardy? base, base?Who, in the lusty stealth of nature, takeMore composition and fierce qualityThan doth, within a dull, stale, tired bed,Go to the creating a whole tribe of fops,Got 'tween asleep and wake? Well, then,Legitimate Edgar, I must have your land:Our father's love is to the bastard EdmundAs to the legitimate: fine word,--legitimate!Well, my legitimate, if this letter speed,And my invention thrive, Edmund the baseShall top the legitimate. I grow; I prosper:Now, gods, stand up for bastards!Enter GLOUCESTER


GLOUCESTER

Kent banish'd thus! and France in choler parted!And the king gone to-night! subscribed his power!Confined to exhibition! All this doneUpon the gad! Edmund, how now! what news?

EDMUND

So please your lordship, none.Putting up the letter


GLOUCESTER

Why so earnestly seek you to put up that letter?

EDMUND

I know no news, my lord.

GLOUCESTER

What paper were you reading?

EDMUND

Nothing, my lord.

GLOUCESTER

No? What needed, then, that terrible dispatch ofit into your pocket? the quality of nothing hathnot such need to hide itself. Let's see: come,if it be nothing, I shall not need spectacles.

EDMUND

I beseech you, sir, pardon me: it is a letterfrom my brother, that I have not all o'er-read;and for so much as I have perused, I find it notfit for your o'er-looking.

GLOUCESTER

Give me the letter, sir.

EDMUND

I shall offend, either to detain or give it. Thecontents, as in part I understand them, are to blame.

GLOUCESTER

Let's see, let's see.

EDMUND

I hope, for my brother's justification, he wrotethis but as an essay or taste of my virtue.

GLOUCESTER

[Reads]  'This policy and reverence of age makesthe world bitter to the best of our times; keepsour fortunes from us till our oldness cannot relishthem. I begin to find an idle and fond bondagein the oppression of aged tyranny; who sways, notas it hath power, but as it is suffered. Come tome, that of this I may speak more. If our fatherwould sleep till I waked him, you should half hisrevenue for ever, and live the beloved of yourbrother,	EDGAR.'Hum--conspiracy!--'Sleep till I waked him,--youshould enjoy half his revenue,'--My son Edgar!Had he a hand to write this? a heart and brainto breed it in?--When came this to you? whobrought it?

EDMUND

It was not brought me, my lord; there's thecunning of it; I found it thrown in at thecasement of my closet.

GLOUCESTER

You know the character to be your brother's?

EDMUND

If the matter were good, my lord, I durst swearit were his; but, in respect of that, I wouldfain think it were not.

GLOUCESTER

It is his.

EDMUND

It is his hand, my lord; but I hope his heart isnot in the contents.

GLOUCESTER

Hath he never heretofore sounded you in this business?

EDMUND

Never, my lord: but I have heard him oftmaintain it to be fit, that, sons at perfect age,and fathers declining, the father should be asward to the son, and the son manage his revenue.

GLOUCESTER

O villain, villain! His very opinion in theletter! Abhorred villain! Unnatural, detested,brutish villain! worse than brutish! Go, sirrah,seek him; I'll apprehend him: abominable villain!Where is he?

EDMUND

I do not well know, my lord. If it shall pleaseyou to suspend your indignation against mybrother till you can derive from him bettertestimony of his intent, you shall run a certaincourse; where, if you violently proceed againsthim, mistaking his purpose, it would make a greatgap in your own honour, and shake in pieces theheart of his obedience. I dare pawn down my lifefor him, that he hath wrote this to feel myaffection to your honour, and to no furtherpretence of danger.

GLOUCESTER

Think you so?

EDMUND

If your honour judge it meet, I will place youwhere you shall hear us confer of this, and by anauricular assurance have your satisfaction; andthat without any further delay than this very evening.

GLOUCESTER

He cannot be such a monster--

EDMUND

Nor is not, sure.

GLOUCESTER

To his father, that so tenderly and entirelyloves him. Heaven and earth! Edmund, seek himout: wind me into him, I pray you: frame thebusiness after your own wisdom. I would unstatemyself, to be in a due resolution.

EDMUND

I will seek him, sir, presently: convey thebusiness as I shall find means and acquaint you withal.

GLOUCESTER

These late eclipses in the sun and moon portendno good to us: though the wisdom of nature canreason it thus and thus, yet nature finds itselfscourged by the sequent effects: love cools,friendship falls off, brothers divide: incities, mutinies; in countries, discord; inpalaces, treason; and the bond cracked 'twixt sonand father. This villain of mine comes under theprediction; there's son against father: the kingfalls from bias of nature; there's father againstchild. We have seen the best of our time:machinations, hollowness, treachery, and allruinous disorders, follow us disquietly to ourgraves. Find out this villain, Edmund; it shalllose thee nothing; do it carefully. And thenoble and true-hearted Kent banished! hisoffence, honesty! 'Tis strange.Exit


EDMUND

This is the excellent foppery of the world, that,when we are sick in fortune,--often the surfeitof our own behavior,--we make guilty of ourdisasters the sun, the moon, and the stars: asif we were villains by necessity; fools byheavenly compulsion; knaves, thieves, andtreachers, by spherical predominance; drunkards,liars, and adulterers, by an enforced obedience ofplanetary influence; and all that we are evil in,by a divine thrusting on: an admirable evasionof whoremaster man, to lay his goatishdisposition to the charge of a star! Myfather compounded with my mother under thedragon's tail; and my nativity was under Ursamajor; so that it follows, I am rough andlecherous. Tut, I should have been that I am,had the maidenliest star in the firmamenttwinkled on my bastardizing. Edgar--Enter EDGAR
And pat he comes like the catastrophe of the oldcomedy: my cue is villanous melancholy, with asigh like Tom o' Bedlam. O, these eclipses doportend these divisions! fa, sol, la, mi.

EDGAR

How now, brother Edmund! what seriouscontemplation are you in?

EDMUND

I am thinking, brother, of a prediction I readthis other day, what should follow these eclipses.

EDGAR

Do you busy yourself about that?

EDMUND

I promise you, the effects he writes of succeedunhappily; as of unnaturalness between the childand the parent; death, dearth, dissolutions ofancient amities; divisions in state, menaces andmaledictions against king and nobles; needlessdiffidences, banishment of friends, dissipationof cohorts, nuptial breaches, and I know not what.

EDGAR

How long have you been a sectary astronomical?

EDMUND

Come, come; when saw you my father last?

EDGAR

Why, the night gone by.

EDMUND

Spake you with him?

EDGAR

Ay, two hours together.

EDMUND

Parted you in good terms? Found you nodispleasure in him by word or countenance?

EDGAR

None at all.

EDMUND

Bethink yourself wherein you may have offendedhim: and at my entreaty forbear his presencetill some little time hath qualified the heat ofhis displeasure; which at this instant so ragethin him, that with the mischief of your person itwould scarcely allay.

EDGAR

Some villain hath done me wrong.

EDMUND

That's my fear. I pray you, have a continentforbearance till the spied of his rage goesslower; and, as I say, retire with me to mylodging, from whence I will fitly bring you tohear my lord speak: pray ye, go; there's my key:if you do stir abroad, go armed.

EDGAR

Armed, brother!

EDMUND

Brother, I advise you to the best; go armed: Iam no honest man if there be any good meaningtowards you: I have told you what I have seenand heard; but faintly, nothing like the imageand horror of it: pray you, away.

EDGAR

Shall I hear from you anon?

EDMUND

I do serve you in this business.Exit EDGAR
A credulous father! and a brother noble,Whose nature is so far from doing harms,That he suspects none: on whose foolish honestyMy practises ride easy! I see the business.Let me, if not by birth, have lands by wit:All with me's meet that I can fashion fit.Exit

SCENE III. The Duke of Albany's palace.

Enter GONERIL, and OSWALD, her steward


GONERIL

Did my father strike my gentleman for chiding of his fool?

OSWALD

Yes, madam.

GONERIL

By day and night he wrongs me; every hourHe flashes into one gross crime or other,That sets us all at odds: I'll not endure it:His knights grow riotous, and himself upbraids usOn every trifle. When he returns from hunting,I will not speak with him; say I am sick:If you come slack of former services,You shall do well; the fault of it I'll answer.

OSWALD

He's coming, madam; I hear him.Horns within


GONERIL

Put on what weary negligence you please,You and your fellows; I'll have it come to question:If he dislike it, let him to our sister,Whose mind and mine, I know, in that are one,Not to be over-ruled. Idle old man,That still would manage those authoritiesThat he hath given away! Now, by my life,Old fools are babes again; and must be usedWith cheques as flatteries,--when they are seen abused.Remember what I tell you.

OSWALD

Well, madam.

GONERIL

And let his knights have colder looks among you;What grows of it, no matter; advise your fellows so:I would breed from hence occasions, and I shall,That I may speak: I'll write straight to my sister,To hold my very course. Prepare for dinner.Exeunt

SCENE IV. A hall in the same.

Enter KENT, disguised


KENT

If but as well I other accents borrow,That can my speech defuse, my good intentMay carry through itself to that full issueFor which I razed my likeness. Now, banish'd Kent,If thou canst serve where thou dost stand condemn'd,So may it come, thy master, whom thou lovest,Shall find thee full of labours.Horns within. Enter KING LEAR, Knights, and Attendants


KING LEAR

Let me not stay a jot for dinner; go get it ready.Exit an Attendant
How now! what art thou?

KENT

A man, sir.

KING LEAR

What dost thou profess? what wouldst thou with us?

KENT

I do profess to be no less than I seem; to servehim truly that will put me in trust: to love himthat is honest; to converse with him that is wise,and says little; to fear judgment; to fight when Icannot choose; and to eat no fish.

KING LEAR

What art thou?

KENT

A very honest-hearted fellow, and as poor as the king.

KING LEAR

If thou be as poor for a subject as he is for aking, thou art poor enough. What wouldst thou?

KENT

Service.

KING LEAR

Who wouldst thou serve?

KENT

You.

KING LEAR

Dost thou know me, fellow?

KENT

No, sir; but you have that in your countenancewhich I would fain call master.

KING LEAR

What's that?

KENT

Authority.

KING LEAR

What services canst thou do?

KENT

I can keep honest counsel, ride, run, mar a curioustale in telling it, and deliver a plain messagebluntly: that which ordinary men are fit for, I amqualified in; and the best of me is diligence.

KING LEAR

How old art thou?

KENT

Not so young, sir, to love a woman for singing, norso old to dote on her for any thing: I have yearson my back forty eight.

KING LEAR

Follow me; thou shalt serve me: if I like thee noworse after dinner, I will not part from thee yet.Dinner, ho, dinner! Where's my knave? my fool?Go you, and call my fool hither.Exit an Attendant
Enter OSWALD
You, you, sirrah, where's my daughter?

OSWALD

So please you,--Exit


KING LEAR

What says the fellow there? Call the clotpoll back.Exit a Knight
Where's my fool, ho? I think the world's asleep.Re-enter Knight
How now! where's that mongrel?

Knight

He says, my lord, your daughter is not well.

KING LEAR

Why came not the slave back to me when I called him.

Knight

Sir, he answered me in the roundest manner, he wouldnot.

KING LEAR

He would not!

Knight

My lord, I know not what the matter is; but, to myjudgment, your highness is not entertained with thatceremonious affection as you were wont; there's agreat abatement of kindness appears as well in thegeneral dependants as in the duke himself also andyour daughter.

KING LEAR

Ha! sayest thou so?

Knight

I beseech you, pardon me, my lord, if I be mistaken;for my duty cannot be silent when I think yourhighness wronged.

KING LEAR

Thou but rememberest me of mine own conception: Ihave perceived a most faint neglect of late; which Ihave rather blamed as mine own jealous curiositythan as a very pretence and purpose of unkindness:I will look further into't. But where's my fool? Ihave not seen him this two days.

Knight

Since my young lady's going into France, sir, thefool hath much pined away.

KING LEAR

No more of that; I have noted it well. Go you, andtell my daughter I would speak with her.Exit an Attendant
Go you, call hither my fool.Exit an Attendant
Re-enter OSWALD
O, you sir, you, come you hither, sir: who am I,sir?

OSWALD

My lady's father.

KING LEAR

'My lady's father'! my lord's knave: yourwhoreson dog! you slave! you cur!

OSWALD

I am none of these, my lord; I beseech your pardon.

KING LEAR

Do you bandy looks with me, you rascal?Striking him


OSWALD

I'll not be struck, my lord.

KENT

Nor tripped neither, you base football player.Tripping up his heels


KING LEAR

I thank thee, fellow; thou servest me, and I'lllove thee.

KENT

Come, sir, arise, away! I'll teach you differences:away, away! if you will measure your lubber'slength again, tarry: but away! go to; have youwisdom? so.Pushes OSWALD out


KING LEAR

Now, my friendly knave, I thank thee: there'searnest of thy service.Giving KENT money
Enter Fool


Fool

Let me hire him too: here's my coxcomb.Offering KENT his cap


KING LEAR

How now, my pretty knave! how dost thou?

Fool

Sirrah, you were best take my coxcomb.

KENT

Why, fool?

Fool

Why, for taking one's part that's out of favour:nay, an thou canst not smile as the wind sits,thou'lt catch cold shortly: there, take my coxcomb:why, this fellow has banished two on's daughters,and did the third a blessing against his will; ifthou follow him, thou must needs wear my coxcomb.How now, nuncle! Would I had two coxcombs and two daughters!

KING LEAR

Why, my boy?

Fool

If I gave them all my living, I'ld keep my coxcombsmyself. There's mine; beg another of thy daughters.

KING LEAR

Take heed, sirrah; the whip.

Fool

Truth's a dog must to kennel; he must be whippedout, when Lady the brach may stand by the fire and stink.

KING LEAR

A pestilent gall to me!

Fool

Sirrah, I'll teach thee a speech.

KING LEAR

Do.

Fool

Mark it, nuncle:Have more than thou showest,Speak less than thou knowest,Lend less than thou owest,Ride more than thou goest,Learn more than thou trowest,Set less than thou throwest;Leave thy drink and thy whore,And keep in-a-door,And thou shalt have moreThan two tens to a score.

KENT

This is nothing, fool.

Fool

Then 'tis like the breath of an unfee'd lawyer; yougave me nothing for't. Can you make no use ofnothing, nuncle?

KING LEAR

Why, no, boy; nothing can be made out of nothing.

Fool

[To KENT]  Prithee, tell him, so much the rent ofhis land comes to: he will not believe a fool.

KING LEAR

A bitter fool!

Fool

Dost thou know the difference, my boy, between abitter fool and a sweet fool?

KING LEAR

No, lad; teach me.

Fool

That lord that counsell'd theeTo give away thy land,Come place him here by me,Do thou for him stand:The sweet and bitter foolWill presently appear;The one in motley here,The other found out there.

KING LEAR

Dost thou call me fool, boy?

Fool

All thy other titles thou hast given away; thatthou wast born with.

KENT

This is not altogether fool, my lord.

Fool

No, faith, lords and great men will not let me; ifI had a monopoly out, they would have part on't:and ladies too, they will not let me have all foolto myself; they'll be snatching. Give me an egg,nuncle, and I'll give thee two crowns.

KING LEAR

What two crowns shall they be?

Fool

Why, after I have cut the egg i' the middle, and eatup the meat, the two crowns of the egg. When thouclovest thy crown i' the middle, and gavest awayboth parts, thou borest thy ass on thy back o'erthe dirt: thou hadst little wit in thy bald crown,when thou gavest thy golden one away. If I speaklike myself in this, let him be whipped that firstfinds it so.Singing
Fools had ne'er less wit in a year;For wise men are grown foppish,They know not how their wits to wear,Their manners are so apish.

KING LEAR

When were you wont to be so full of songs, sirrah?

Fool

I have used it, nuncle, ever since thou madest thydaughters thy mothers: for when thou gavest themthe rod, and put'st down thine own breeches,Singing
Then they for sudden joy did weep,And I for sorrow sung,That such a king should play bo-peep,And go the fools among.Prithee, nuncle, keep a schoolmaster that can teachthy fool to lie: I would fain learn to lie.

KING LEAR

An you lie, sirrah, we'll have you whipped.

Fool

I marvel what kin thou and thy daughters are:they'll have me whipped for speaking true, thou'lthave me whipped for lying; and sometimes I amwhipped for holding my peace. I had rather be anykind o' thing than a fool: and yet I would not bethee, nuncle; thou hast pared thy wit o' both sides,and left nothing i' the middle: here comes one o'the parings.Enter GONERIL


KING LEAR

How now, daughter! what makes that frontlet on?Methinks you are too much of late i' the frown.

Fool

Thou wast a pretty fellow when thou hadst no need tocare for her frowning; now thou art an O without afigure: I am better than thou art now; I am a fool,thou art nothing.To GONERIL
Yes, forsooth, I will hold my tongue; so your facebids me, though you say nothing. Mum, mum,He that keeps nor crust nor crum,Weary of all, shall want some.Pointing to KING LEAR
That's a shealed peascod.

GONERIL

Not only, sir, this your all-licensed fool,But other of your insolent retinueDo hourly carp and quarrel; breaking forthIn rank and not-to-be endured riots. Sir,I had thought, by making this well known unto you,To have found a safe redress; but now grow fearful,By what yourself too late have spoke and done.That you protect this course, and put it onBy your allowance; which if you should, the faultWould not 'scape censure, nor the redresses sleep,Which, in the tender of a wholesome weal,Might in their working do you that offence,Which else were shame, that then necessityWill call discreet proceeding.

Fool

For, you trow, nuncle,The hedge-sparrow fed the cuckoo so long,That it's had it head bit off by it young.So, out went the candle, and we were left darkling.

KING LEAR

Are you our daughter?

GONERIL

Come, sir,I would you would make use of that good wisdom,Whereof I know you are fraught; and put awayThese dispositions, that of late transform youFrom what you rightly are.

Fool

May not an ass know when the cartdraws the horse? Whoop, Jug! I love thee.

KING LEAR

Doth any here know me? This is not Lear:Doth Lear walk thus? speak thus? Where are his eyes?Either his notion weakens, his discerningsAre lethargied--Ha! waking? 'tis not so.Who is it that can tell me who I am?

Fool

Lear's shadow.

KING LEAR

I would learn that; for, by themarks of sovereignty, knowledge, and reason,I should be false persuaded I had daughters.

Fool

Which they will make an obedient father.

KING LEAR

Your name, fair gentlewoman?

GONERIL

This admiration, sir, is much o' the savourOf other your new pranks. I do beseech youTo understand my purposes aright:As you are old and reverend, you should be wise.Here do you keep a hundred knights and squires;Men so disorder'd, so debosh'd and bold,That this our court, infected with their manners,Shows like a riotous inn: epicurism and lustMake it more like a tavern or a brothelThan a graced palace. The shame itself doth speakFor instant remedy: be then desiredBy her, that else will take the thing she begs,A little to disquantity your train;And the remainder, that shall still depend,To be such men as may besort your age,And know themselves and you.

KING LEAR

Darkness and devils!Saddle my horses; call my train together:Degenerate bastard! I'll not trouble thee.Yet have I left a daughter.

GONERIL

You strike my people; and your disorder'd rabbleMake servants of their betters.Enter ALBANY


KING LEAR

Woe, that too late repents,--To ALBANY
O, sir, are you come?Is it your will? Speak, sir. Prepare my horses.Ingratitude, thou marble-hearted fiend,More hideous when thou show'st thee in a childThan the sea-monster!

ALBANY

Pray, sir, be patient.

KING LEAR

[To GONERIL]  Detested kite! thou liest.My train are men of choice and rarest parts,That all particulars of duty know,And in the most exact regard supportThe worships of their name. O most small fault,How ugly didst thou in Cordelia show!That, like an engine, wrench'd my frame of natureFrom the fix'd place; drew from heart all love,And added to the gall. O Lear, Lear, Lear!Beat at this gate, that let thy folly in,Striking his head
And thy dear judgment out! Go, go, my people.

ALBANY

My lord, I am guiltless, as I am ignorantOf what hath moved you.

KING LEAR

It may be so, my lord.Hear, nature, hear; dear goddess, hear!Suspend thy purpose, if thou didst intendTo make this creature fruitful!Into her womb convey sterility!Dry up in her the organs of increase;And from her derogate body never springA babe to honour her! If she must teem,Create her child of spleen; that it may live,And be a thwart disnatured torment to her!Let it stamp wrinkles in her brow of youth;With cadent tears fret channels in her cheeks;Turn all her mother's pains and benefitsTo laughter and contempt; that she may feelHow sharper than a serpent's tooth it isTo have a thankless child! Away, away!Exit


ALBANY

Now, gods that we adore, whereof comes this?

GONERIL

Never afflict yourself to know the cause;But let his disposition have that scopeThat dotage gives it.Re-enter KING LEAR


KING LEAR

What, fifty of my followers at a clap!Within a fortnight!

ALBANY

What's the matter, sir?

KING LEAR

I'll tell thee:To GONERIL
Life and death! I am ashamedThat thou hast power to shake my manhood thus;That these hot tears, which break from me perforce,Should make thee worth them. Blasts and fogs upon thee!The untented woundings of a father's cursePierce every sense about thee! Old fond eyes,Beweep this cause again, I'll pluck ye out,And cast you, with the waters that you lose,To temper clay. Yea, it is come to this?Let is be so: yet have I left a daughter,Who, I am sure, is kind and comfortable:When she shall hear this of thee, with her nailsShe'll flay thy wolvish visage. Thou shalt findThat I'll resume the shape which thou dost thinkI have cast off for ever: thou shalt,I warrant thee.Exeunt KING LEAR, KENT, and Attendants


GONERIL

Do you mark that, my lord?

ALBANY

I cannot be so partial, Goneril,To the great love I bear you,--

GONERIL

Pray you, content. What, Oswald, ho!To the Fool
You, sir, more knave than fool, after your master.

Fool

Nuncle Lear, nuncle Lear, tarry and take the foolwith thee.A fox, when one has caught her,And such a daughter,Should sure to the slaughter,If my cap would buy a halter:So the fool follows after.Exit


GONERIL

This man hath had good counsel:--a hundred knights!'Tis politic and safe to let him keepAt point a hundred knights: yes, that, on every dream,Each buzz, each fancy, each complaint, dislike,He may enguard his dotage with their powers,And hold our lives in mercy. Oswald, I say!

ALBANY

Well, you may fear too far.

GONERIL

Safer than trust too far:Let me still take away the harms I fear,Not fear still to be taken: I know his heart.What he hath utter'd I have writ my sisterIf she sustain him and his hundred knightsWhen I have show'd the unfitness,--Re-enter OSWALD
How now, Oswald!What, have you writ that letter to my sister?

OSWALD

Yes, madam.

GONERIL

Take you some company, and away to horse:Inform her full of my particular fear;And thereto add such reasons of your ownAs may compact it more. Get you gone;And hasten your return.Exit OSWALD
No, no, my lord,This milky gentleness and course of yoursThough I condemn not, yet, under pardon,You are much more attask'd for want of wisdomThan praised for harmful mildness.

ALBANY

How far your eyes may pierce I can not tell:Striving to better, oft we mar what's well.

GONERIL

Nay, then--

ALBANY

Well, well; the event.Exeunt

SCENE V. Court before the same.

Enter KING LEAR, KENT, and Fool


KING LEAR

Go you before to Gloucester with these letters.Acquaint my daughter no further with any thing youknow than comes from her demand out of the letter.If your diligence be not speedy, I shall be there afore you.

KENT

I will not sleep, my lord, till I have deliveredyour letter.Exit


Fool

If a man's brains were in's heels, were't not indanger of kibes?

KING LEAR

Ay, boy.

Fool

Then, I prithee, be merry; thy wit shall ne'er goslip-shod.

KING LEAR

Ha, ha, ha!

Fool

Shalt see thy other daughter will use thee kindly;for though she's as like this as a crab's like anapple, yet I can tell what I can tell.

KING LEAR

Why, what canst thou tell, my boy?

Fool

She will taste as like this as a crab does to acrab. Thou canst tell why one's nose stands i'the middle on's face?

KING LEAR

No.

Fool

Why, to keep one's eyes of either side's nose; thatwhat a man cannot smell out, he may spy into.

KING LEAR

I did her wrong--

Fool

Canst tell how an oyster makes his shell?

KING LEAR

No.

Fool

Nor I neither; but I can tell why a snail has a house.

KING LEAR

Why?

Fool

Why, to put his head in; not to give it away to hisdaughters, and leave his horns without a case.

KING LEAR

I will forget my nature. So kind a father! Be myhorses ready?

Fool

Thy asses are gone about 'em. The reason why theseven stars are no more than seven is a pretty reason.

KING LEAR

Because they are not eight?

Fool

Yes, indeed: thou wouldst make a good fool.

KING LEAR

To take 't again perforce! Monster ingratitude!

Fool

If thou wert my fool, nuncle, I'ld have thee beatenfor being old before thy time.

KING LEAR

How's that?

Fool

Thou shouldst not have been old till thou hadstbeen wise.

KING LEAR

O, let me not be mad, not mad, sweet heavenKeep me in temper: I would not be mad!Enter Gentleman
How now! are the horses ready?

Gentleman

Ready, my lord.

KING LEAR

Come, boy.

Fool

She that's a maid now, and laughs at my departure,Shall not be a maid long, unless things be cut shorter.Exeunt

ACT II
SCENE I. GLOUCESTER's castle.

Enter EDMUND, and CURAN meets him


EDMUND

Save thee, Curan.

CURAN

And you, sir. I have been with your father, andgiven him notice that the Duke of Cornwall and Reganhis duchess will be here with him this night.

EDMUND

How comes that?

CURAN

Nay, I know not. You have heard of the news abroad;I mean the whispered ones, for they are yet butear-kissing arguments?

EDMUND

Not I	pray you, what are they?

CURAN

Have you heard of no likely wars toward, 'twixt theDukes of Cornwall and Albany?

EDMUND

Not a word.

CURAN

You may do, then, in time. Fare you well, sir.Exit


EDMUND

The duke be here to-night? The better! best!This weaves itself perforce into my business.My father hath set guard to take my brother;And I have one thing, of a queasy question,Which I must act: briefness and fortune, work!Brother, a word; descend: brother, I say!Enter EDGAR
My father watches: O sir, fly this place;Intelligence is given where you are hid;You have now the good advantage of the night:Have you not spoken 'gainst the Duke of Cornwall?He's coming hither: now, i' the night, i' the haste,And Regan with him: have you nothing saidUpon his party 'gainst the Duke of Albany?Advise yourself.

EDGAR

                  I am sure on't, not a word.

EDMUND

I hear my father coming: pardon me:In cunning I must draw my sword upon youDraw; seem to defend yourself; now quit you well.Yield: come before my father. Light, ho, here!Fly, brother. Torches, torches! So, farewell.Exit EDGAR
Some blood drawn on me would beget opinion.Wounds his arm
Of my more fierce endeavour: I have seen drunkardsDo more than this in sport. Father, father!Stop, stop! No help?Enter GLOUCESTER, and Servants with torches


GLOUCESTER

Now, Edmund, where's the villain?

EDMUND

Here stood he in the dark, his sharp sword out,Mumbling of wicked charms, conjuring the moonTo stand auspicious mistress,--

GLOUCESTER

But where is he?

EDMUND

Look, sir, I bleed.

GLOUCESTER

Where is the villain, Edmund?

EDMUND

Fled this way, sir. When by no means he could--

GLOUCESTER

Pursue him, ho! Go after.Exeunt some Servants
By no means what?

EDMUND

Persuade me to the murder of your lordship;But that I told him, the revenging gods'Gainst parricides did all their thunders bend;Spoke, with how manifold and strong a bondThe child was bound to the father; sir, in fine,Seeing how loathly opposite I stoodTo his unnatural purpose, in fell motion,With his prepared sword, he charges homeMy unprovided body, lanced mine arm:But when he saw my best alarum'd spirits,Bold in the quarrel's right, roused to the encounter,Or whether gasted by the noise I made,Full suddenly he fled.

GLOUCESTER

Let him fly far:Not in this land shall he remain uncaught;And found--dispatch. The noble duke my master,My worthy arch and patron, comes to-night:By his authority I will proclaim it,That he which finds him shall deserve our thanks,Bringing the murderous coward to the stake;He that conceals him, death.

EDMUND

When I dissuaded him from his intent,And found him pight to do it, with curst speechI threaten'd to discover him: he replied,'Thou unpossessing bastard! dost thou think,If I would stand against thee, would the reposalOf any trust, virtue, or worth in theeMake thy words faith'd? No: what I should deny,--As this I would: ay, though thou didst produceMy very character,--I'ld turn it allTo thy suggestion, plot, and damned practise:And thou must make a dullard of the world,If they not thought the profits of my deathWere very pregnant and potential spursTo make thee seek it.'

GLOUCESTER

Strong and fasten'd villainWould he deny his letter? I never got him.Tucket within
Hark, the duke's trumpets! I know not why he comes.All ports I'll bar; the villain shall not 'scape;The duke must grant me that: besides, his pictureI will send far and near, that all the kingdomMay have the due note of him; and of my land,Loyal and natural boy, I'll work the meansTo make thee capable.Enter CORNWALL, REGAN, and Attendants


CORNWALL

How now, my noble friend! since I came hither,Which I can call but now, I have heard strange news.

REGAN

If it be true, all vengeance comes too shortWhich can pursue the offender. How dost, my lord?

GLOUCESTER

O, madam, my old heart is crack'd, it's crack'd!

REGAN

What, did my father's godson seek your life?He whom my father named? your Edgar?

GLOUCESTER

O, lady, lady, shame would have it hid!

REGAN

Was he not companion with the riotous knightsThat tend upon my father?

GLOUCESTER

I know not, madam: 'tis too bad, too bad.

EDMUND

Yes, madam, he was of that consort.

REGAN

No marvel, then, though he were ill affected:'Tis they have put him on the old man's death,To have the expense and waste of his revenues.I have this present evening from my sisterBeen well inform'd of them; and with such cautions,That if they come to sojourn at my house,I'll not be there.

CORNWALL

Nor I, assure thee, Regan.Edmund, I hear that you have shown your fatherA child-like office.

EDMUND

'Twas my duty, sir.

GLOUCESTER

He did bewray his practise; and receivedThis hurt you see, striving to apprehend him.

CORNWALL

Is he pursued?

GLOUCESTER

                  Ay, my good lord.

CORNWALL

If he be taken, he shall never moreBe fear'd of doing harm: make your own purpose,How in my strength you please. For you, Edmund,Whose virtue and obedience doth this instantSo much commend itself, you shall be ours:Natures of such deep trust we shall much need;You we first seize on.

EDMUND

I shall serve you, sir,Truly, however else.

GLOUCESTER

For him I thank your grace.

CORNWALL

You know not why we came to visit you,--

REGAN

Thus out of season, threading dark-eyed night:Occasions, noble Gloucester, of some poise,Wherein we must have use of your advice:Our father he hath writ, so hath our sister,Of differences, which I least thought it fitTo answer from our home; the several messengersFrom hence attend dispatch. Our good old friend,Lay comforts to your bosom; and bestowYour needful counsel to our business,Which craves the instant use.

GLOUCESTER

I serve you, madam:Your graces are right welcome.Exeunt

SCENE II. Before Gloucester's castle.

Enter KENT and OSWALD, severally


OSWALD

Good dawning to thee, friend: art of this house?

KENT

Ay.

OSWALD

Where may we set our horses?

KENT

I' the mire.

OSWALD

Prithee, if thou lovest me, tell me.

KENT

I love thee not.

OSWALD

Why, then, I care not for thee.

KENT

If I had thee in Lipsbury pinfold, I would make theecare for me.

OSWALD

Why dost thou use me thus? I know thee not.

KENT

Fellow, I know thee.

OSWALD

What dost thou know me for?

KENT

A knave; a rascal; an eater of broken meats; abase, proud, shallow, beggarly, three-suited,hundred-pound, filthy, worsted-stocking knave; alily-livered, action-taking knave, a whoreson,glass-gazing, super-serviceable finical rogue;one-trunk-inheriting slave; one that wouldst be abawd, in way of good service, and art nothing butthe composition of a knave, beggar, coward, pandar,and the son and heir of a mongrel bitch: one whom Iwill beat into clamorous whining, if thou deniestthe least syllable of thy addition.

OSWALD

Why, what a monstrous fellow art thou, thus to railon one that is neither known of thee nor knows thee!

KENT

What a brazen-faced varlet art thou, to deny thouknowest me! Is it two days ago since I tripped upthy heels, and beat thee before the king? Draw, yourogue: for, though it be night, yet the moonshines; I'll make a sop o' the moonshine of you:draw, you whoreson cullionly barber-monger, draw.Drawing his sword


OSWALD

Away! I have nothing to do with thee.

KENT

Draw, you rascal: you come with letters against theking; and take vanity the puppet's part against theroyalty of her father: draw, you rogue, or I'll socarbonado your shanks: draw, you rascal; come your ways.

OSWALD

Help, ho! murder! help!

KENT

Strike, you slave; stand, rogue, stand; you neatslave, strike.Beating him


OSWALD

Help, ho! murder! murder!Enter EDMUND, with his rapier drawn, CORNWALL, REGAN, GLOUCESTER, and Servants


EDMUND

How now! What's the matter?

KENT

With you, goodman boy, an you please: come, I'llflesh ye; come on, young master.

GLOUCESTER

Weapons! arms! What 's the matter here?

CORNWALL

Keep peace, upon your lives:He dies that strikes again. What is the matter?

REGAN

The messengers from our sister and the king.

CORNWALL

What is your difference? speak.

OSWALD

I am scarce in breath, my lord.

KENT

No marvel, you have so bestirred your valour. Youcowardly rascal, nature disclaims in thee: atailor made thee.

CORNWALL

Thou art a strange fellow: a tailor make a man?

KENT

Ay, a tailor, sir: a stone-cutter or painter couldnot have made him so ill, though he had been but twohours at the trade.

CORNWALL

Speak yet, how grew your quarrel?

OSWALD

This ancient ruffian, sir, whose life I have sparedat suit of his gray beard,--

KENT

Thou whoreson zed! thou unnecessary letter! Mylord, if you will give me leave, I will tread thisunbolted villain into mortar, and daub the wall ofa jakes with him. Spare my gray beard, you wagtail?

CORNWALL

Peace, sirrah!You beastly knave, know you no reverence?

KENT

Yes, sir; but anger hath a privilege.

CORNWALL

Why art thou angry?

KENT

That such a slave as this should wear a sword,Who wears no honesty. Such smiling rogues as these,Like rats, oft bite the holy cords a-twainWhich are too intrinse t' unloose; smooth every passionThat in the natures of their lords rebel;Bring oil to fire, snow to their colder moods;Renege, affirm, and turn their halcyon beaksWith every gale and vary of their masters,Knowing nought, like dogs, but following.A plague upon your epileptic visage!Smile you my speeches, as I were a fool?Goose, if I had you upon Sarum plain,I'ld drive ye cackling home to Camelot.

CORNWALL

Why, art thou mad, old fellow?

GLOUCESTER

How fell you out? say that.

KENT

No contraries hold more antipathyThan I and such a knave.

CORNWALL

Why dost thou call him a knave?  What's his offence?

KENT

His countenance likes me not.

CORNWALL

No more, perchance, does mine, nor his, nor hers.

KENT

Sir, 'tis my occupation to be plain:I have seen better faces in my timeThan stands on any shoulder that I seeBefore me at this instant.

CORNWALL

This is some fellow,Who, having been praised for bluntness, doth affectA saucy roughness, and constrains the garbQuite from his nature: he cannot flatter, he,An honest mind and plain, he must speak truth!An they will take it, so; if not, he's plain.These kind of knaves I know, which in this plainnessHarbour more craft and more corrupter endsThan twenty silly ducking observantsThat stretch their duties nicely.

KENT

Sir, in good sooth, in sincere verity,Under the allowance of your great aspect,Whose influence, like the wreath of radiant fireOn flickering Phoebus' front,--

CORNWALL

What mean'st by this?

KENT

To go out of my dialect, which youdiscommend so much. I know, sir, I am noflatterer: he that beguiled you in a plainaccent was a plain knave; which for my partI will not be, though I should win your displeasureto entreat me to 't.

CORNWALL

What was the offence you gave him?

OSWALD

I never gave him any:It pleased the king his master very lateTo strike at me, upon his misconstruction;When he, conjunct and flattering his displeasure,Tripp'd me behind; being down, insulted, rail'd,And put upon him such a deal of man,That worthied him, got praises of the kingFor him attempting who was self-subdued;And, in the fleshment of this dread exploit,Drew on me here again.

KENT

None of these rogues and cowardsBut Ajax is their fool.

CORNWALL

Fetch forth the stocks!You stubborn ancient knave, you reverend braggart,We'll teach you--

KENT

                  Sir, I am too old to learn:Call not your stocks for me: I serve the king;On whose employment I was sent to you:You shall do small respect, show too bold maliceAgainst the grace and person of my master,Stocking his messenger.

CORNWALL

Fetch forth the stocks! As I have life and honour,There shall he sit till noon.

REGAN

Till noon! till night, my lord; and all night too.

KENT

Why, madam, if I were your father's dog,You should not use me so.

REGAN

Sir, being his knave, I will.

CORNWALL

This is a fellow of the self-same colourOur sister speaks of. Come, bring away the stocks!Stocks brought out


GLOUCESTER

Let me beseech your grace not to do so:His fault is much, and the good king his masterWill cheque him for 't: your purposed low correctionIs such as basest and contemned'st wretchesFor pilferings and most common trespassesAre punish'd with: the king must take it ill,That he's so slightly valued in his messenger,Should have him thus restrain'd.

CORNWALL

I'll answer that.

REGAN

My sister may receive it much more worse,To have her gentleman abused, assaulted,For following her affairs. Put in his legs.KENT is put in the stocks
Come, my good lord, away.Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER and KENT


GLOUCESTER

I am sorry for thee, friend; 'tis the duke's pleasure,Whose disposition, all the world well knows,Will not be rubb'd nor stopp'd: I'll entreat for thee.

KENT

Pray, do not, sir: I have watched and travell'd hard;Some time I shall sleep out, the rest I'll whistle.A good man's fortune may grow out at heels:Give you good morrow!

GLOUCESTER

The duke's to blame in this; 'twill be ill taken.Exit


KENT

Good king, that must approve the common saw,Thou out of heaven's benediction comestTo the warm sun!Approach, thou beacon to this under globe,That by thy comfortable beams I mayPeruse this letter! Nothing almost sees miraclesBut misery: I know 'tis from Cordelia,Who hath most fortunately been inform'dOf my obscured course; and shall find timeFrom this enormous state, seeking to giveLosses their remedies. All weary and o'erwatch'd,Take vantage, heavy eyes, not to beholdThis shameful lodging.Fortune, good night: smile once more: turn thy wheel!Sleeps

SCENE III. A wood.

Enter EDGAR


EDGAR

I heard myself proclaim'd;And by the happy hollow of a treeEscaped the hunt. No port is free; no place,That guard, and most unusual vigilance,Does not attend my taking. Whiles I may 'scape,I will preserve myself: and am bethoughtTo take the basest and most poorest shapeThat ever penury, in contempt of man,Brought near to beast: my face I'll grime with filth;Blanket my loins: elf all my hair in knots;And with presented nakedness out-faceThe winds and persecutions of the sky.The country gives me proof and precedentOf Bedlam beggars, who, with roaring voices,Strike in their numb'd and mortified bare armsPins, wooden pricks, nails, sprigs of rosemary;And with this horrible object, from low farms,Poor pelting villages, sheep-cotes, and mills,Sometime with lunatic bans, sometime with prayers,Enforce their charity. Poor Turlygod! poor Tom!That's something yet: Edgar I nothing am.Exit

SCENE IV. Before GLOUCESTER's castle. KENT in the stocks.

Enter KING LEAR, Fool, and Gentleman


KING LEAR

'Tis strange that they should so depart from home,And not send back my messenger.

Gentleman

As I learn'd,The night before there was no purpose in themOf this remove.

KENT

                  Hail to thee, noble master!

KING LEAR

Ha!Makest thou this shame thy pastime?

KENT

No, my lord.

Fool

Ha, ha! he wears cruel garters. Horses are tiedby the heads, dogs and bears by the neck, monkeys bythe loins, and men by the legs: when a man'sover-lusty at legs, then he wears woodennether-stocks.

KING LEAR

What's he that hath so much thy place mistookTo set thee here?

KENT

                  It is both he and she;Your son and daughter.

KING LEAR

No.

KENT

Yes.

KING LEAR

No, I say.

KENT

I say, yea.

KING LEAR

No, no, they would not.

KENT

Yes, they have.

KING LEAR

By Jupiter, I swear, no.

KENT

By Juno, I swear, ay.

KING LEAR

They durst not do 't;They could not, would not do 't; 'tis worse than murder,To do upon respect such violent outrage:Resolve me, with all modest haste, which wayThou mightst deserve, or they impose, this usage,Coming from us.

KENT

                  My lord, when at their homeI did commend your highness' letters to them,Ere I was risen from the place that show'dMy duty kneeling, came there a reeking post,Stew'd in his haste, half breathless, panting forthFrom Goneril his mistress salutations;Deliver'd letters, spite of intermission,Which presently they read: on whose contents,They summon'd up their meiny, straight took horse;Commanded me to follow, and attendThe leisure of their answer; gave me cold looks:And meeting here the other messenger,Whose welcome, I perceived, had poison'd mine,--Being the very fellow that of lateDisplay'd so saucily against your highness,--Having more man than wit about me, drew:He raised the house with loud and coward cries.Your son and daughter found this trespass worthThe shame which here it suffers.

Fool

Winter's not gone yet, if the wild-geese fly that way.Fathers that wear ragsDo make their children blind;But fathers that bear bagsShall see their children kind.Fortune, that arrant whore,Ne'er turns the key to the poor.But, for all this, thou shalt have as many doloursfor thy daughters as thou canst tell in a year.

KING LEAR

O, how this mother swells up toward my heart!Hysterica passio, down, thou climbing sorrow,Thy element's below! Where is this daughter?

KENT

With the earl, sir, here within.

KING LEAR

Follow me not;Stay here.Exit


Gentleman

Made you no more offence but what you speak of?

KENT

None.How chance the king comes with so small a train?

Fool

And thou hadst been set i' the stocks for thatquestion, thou hadst well deserved it.

KENT

Why, fool?

Fool

We'll set thee to school to an ant, to teach theethere's no labouring i' the winter. All that followtheir noses are led by their eyes but blind men; andthere's not a nose among twenty but can smell himthat's stinking. Let go thy hold when a great wheelruns down a hill, lest it break thy neck withfollowing it: but the great one that goes up thehill, let him draw thee after. When a wise mangives thee better counsel, give me mine again: Iwould have none but knaves follow it, since a fool gives it.That sir which serves and seeks for gain,And follows but for form,Will pack when it begins to rain,And leave thee in the storm,But I will tarry; the fool will stay,And let the wise man fly:The knave turns fool that runs away;The fool no knave, perdy.

KENT

Where learned you this, fool?

Fool

Not i' the stocks, fool.Re-enter KING LEAR with GLOUCESTER


KING LEAR

Deny to speak with me? They are sick? they are weary?They have travell'd all the night? Mere fetches;The images of revolt and flying off.Fetch me a better answer.

GLOUCESTER

My dear lord,You know the fiery quality of the duke;How unremoveable and fix'd he isIn his own course.

KING LEAR

Vengeance! plague! death! confusion!Fiery? what quality? Why, Gloucester, Gloucester,I'ld speak with the Duke of Cornwall and his wife.

GLOUCESTER

Well, my good lord, I have inform'd them so.

KING LEAR

Inform'd them! Dost thou understand me, man?

GLOUCESTER

Ay, my good lord.

KING LEAR

The king would speak with Cornwall; the dear fatherWould with his daughter speak, commands her service:Are they inform'd of this? My breath and blood!Fiery? the fiery duke? Tell the hot duke that--No, but not yet: may be he is not well:Infirmity doth still neglect all officeWhereto our health is bound; we are not ourselvesWhen nature, being oppress'd, commands the mindTo suffer with the body: I'll forbear;And am fall'n out with my more headier will,To take the indisposed and sickly fitFor the sound man. Death on my state! whereforeLooking on KENT
Should he sit here? This act persuades meThat this remotion of the duke and herIs practise only. Give me my servant forth.Go tell the duke and 's wife I'ld speak with them,Now, presently: bid them come forth and hear me,Or at their chamber-door I'll beat the drumTill it cry sleep to death.

GLOUCESTER

I would have all well betwixt you.Exit


KING LEAR

O me, my heart, my rising heart! but, down!

Fool

Cry to it, nuncle, as the cockney did to the eelswhen she put 'em i' the paste alive; she knapped 'emo' the coxcombs with a stick, and cried 'Down,wantons, down!' 'Twas her brother that, in purekindness to his horse, buttered his hay.Enter CORNWALL, REGAN, GLOUCESTER, and Servants


KING LEAR

Good morrow to you both.

CORNWALL

Hail to your grace!KENT is set at liberty


REGAN

I am glad to see your highness.

KING LEAR

Regan, I think you are; I know what reasonI have to think so: if thou shouldst not be glad,I would divorce me from thy mother's tomb,Sepulchring an adultress.To KENT
O, are you free?Some other time for that. Beloved Regan,Thy sister's naught: O Regan, she hath tiedSharp-tooth'd unkindness, like a vulture, here:Points to his heart
I can scarce speak to thee; thou'lt not believeWith how depraved a quality--O Regan!

REGAN

I pray you, sir, take patience: I have hope.You less know how to value her desertThan she to scant her duty.

KING LEAR

Say, how is that?

REGAN

I cannot think my sister in the leastWould fail her obligation: if, sir, perchanceShe have restrain'd the riots of your followers,'Tis on such ground, and to such wholesome end,As clears her from all blame.

KING LEAR

My curses on her!

REGAN

                  O, sir, you are old.Nature in you stands on the very vergeOf her confine: you should be ruled and ledBy some discretion, that discerns your stateBetter than you yourself. Therefore, I pray you,That to our sister you do make return;Say you have wrong'd her, sir.

KING LEAR

Ask her forgiveness?Do you but mark how this becomes the house:'Dear daughter, I confess that I am old;Kneeling
Age is unnecessary: on my knees I begThat you'll vouchsafe me raiment, bed, and food.'

REGAN

Good sir, no more; these are unsightly tricks:Return you to my sister.

KING LEAR

[Rising]  Never, Regan:She hath abated me of half my train;Look'd black upon me; struck me with her tongue,Most serpent-like, upon the very heart:All the stored vengeances of heaven fallOn her ingrateful top! Strike her young bones,You taking airs, with lameness!

CORNWALL

Fie, sir, fie!

KING LEAR

You nimble lightnings, dart your blinding flamesInto her scornful eyes! Infect her beauty,You fen-suck'd fogs, drawn by the powerful sun,To fall and blast her pride!

REGAN

O the blest gods! so will you wish on me,When the rash mood is on.

KING LEAR

No, Regan, thou shalt never have my curse:Thy tender-hefted nature shall not giveThee o'er to harshness: her eyes are fierce; but thineDo comfort and not burn. 'Tis not in theeTo grudge my pleasures, to cut off my train,To bandy hasty words, to scant my sizes,And in conclusion to oppose the boltAgainst my coming in: thou better know'stThe offices of nature, bond of childhood,Effects of courtesy, dues of gratitude;Thy half o' the kingdom hast thou not forgot,Wherein I thee endow'd.

REGAN

Good sir, to the purpose.

KING LEAR

Who put my man i' the stocks?Tucket within


CORNWALL

What trumpet's that?

REGAN

I know't, my sister's: this approves her letter,That she would soon be here.Enter OSWALD
Is your lady come?

KING LEAR

This is a slave, whose easy-borrow'd prideDwells in the fickle grace of her he follows.Out, varlet, from my sight!

CORNWALL

What means your grace?

KING LEAR

Who stock'd my servant? Regan, I have good hopeThou didst not know on't. Who comes here? O heavens,Enter GONERIL
If you do love old men, if your sweet swayAllow obedience, if yourselves are old,Make it your cause; send down, and take my part!To GONERIL
Art not ashamed to look upon this beard?O Regan, wilt thou take her by the hand?

GONERIL

Why not by the hand, sir? How have I offended?All's not offence that indiscretion findsAnd dotage terms so.

KING LEAR

O sides, you are too tough;Will you yet hold? How came my man i' the stocks?

CORNWALL

I set him there, sir: but his own disordersDeserved much less advancement.

KING LEAR

You! did you?

REGAN

I pray you, father, being weak, seem so.If, till the expiration of your month,You will return and sojourn with my sister,Dismissing half your train, come then to me:I am now from home, and out of that provisionWhich shall be needful for your entertainment.

KING LEAR

Return to her, and fifty men dismiss'd?No, rather I abjure all roofs, and chooseTo wage against the enmity o' the air;To be a comrade with the wolf and owl,--Necessity's sharp pinch! Return with her?Why, the hot-blooded France, that dowerless tookOur youngest born, I could as well be broughtTo knee his throne, and, squire-like; pension begTo keep base life afoot. Return with her?Persuade me rather to be slave and sumpterTo this detested groom.Pointing at OSWALD


GONERIL

At your choice, sir.

KING LEAR

I prithee, daughter, do not make me mad:I will not trouble thee, my child; farewell:We'll no more meet, no more see one another:But yet thou art my flesh, my blood, my daughter;Or rather a disease that's in my flesh,Which I must needs call mine: thou art a boil,A plague-sore, an embossed carbuncle,In my corrupted blood. But I'll not chide thee;Let shame come when it will, I do not call it:I do not bid the thunder-bearer shoot,Nor tell tales of thee to high-judging Jove:Mend when thou canst; be better at thy leisure:I can be patient; I can stay with Regan,I and my hundred knights.

REGAN

Not altogether so:I look'd not for you yet, nor am providedFor your fit welcome. Give ear, sir, to my sister;For those that mingle reason with your passionMust be content to think you old, and so--But she knows what she does.

KING LEAR

Is this well spoken?

REGAN

I dare avouch it, sir: what, fifty followers?Is it not well? What should you need of more?Yea, or so many, sith that both charge and dangerSpeak 'gainst so great a number? How, in one house,Should many people, under two commands,Hold amity? 'Tis hard; almost impossible.

GONERIL

Why might not you, my lord, receive attendanceFrom those that she calls servants or from mine?

REGAN

Why not, my lord? If then they chanced to slack you,We could control them. If you will come to me,--For now I spy a danger,--I entreat youTo bring but five and twenty: to no moreWill I give place or notice.

KING LEAR

I gave you all--

REGAN

                  And in good time you gave it.

KING LEAR

Made you my guardians, my depositaries;But kept a reservation to be follow'dWith such a number. What, must I come to youWith five and twenty, Regan? said you so?

REGAN

And speak't again, my lord; no more with me.

KING LEAR

Those wicked creatures yet do look well-favour'd,When others are more wicked: not being the worstStands in some rank of praise.To GONERIL
I'll go with thee:Thy fifty yet doth double five and twenty,And thou art twice her love.

GONERIL

Hear me, my lord;What need you five and twenty, ten, or five,To follow in a house where twice so manyHave a command to tend you?

REGAN

What need one?

KING LEAR

O, reason not the need: our basest beggarsAre in the poorest thing superfluous:Allow not nature more than nature needs,Man's life's as cheap as beast's: thou art a lady;If only to go warm were gorgeous,Why, nature needs not what thou gorgeous wear'st,Which scarcely keeps thee warm. But, for true need,--You heavens, give me that patience, patience I need!You see me here, you gods, a poor old man,As full of grief as age; wretched in both!If it be you that stir these daughters' heartsAgainst their father, fool me not so muchTo bear it tamely; touch me with noble anger,And let not women's weapons, water-drops,Stain my man's cheeks! No, you unnatural hags,I will have such revenges on you both,That all the world shall--I will do such things,--What they are, yet I know not: but they shall beThe terrors of the earth. You think I'll weepNo, I'll not weep:I have full cause of weeping; but this heartShall break into a hundred thousand flaws,Or ere I'll weep. O fool, I shall go mad!Exeunt KING LEAR, GLOUCESTER, KENT, and Fool
Storm and tempest


CORNWALL

Let us withdraw; 'twill be a storm.

REGAN

This house is little: the old man and his peopleCannot be well bestow'd.

GONERIL

'Tis his own blame; hath put himself from rest,And must needs taste his folly.

REGAN

For his particular, I'll receive him gladly,But not one follower.

GONERIL

So am I purposed.Where is my lord of Gloucester?

CORNWALL

Follow'd the old man forth: he is return'd.Re-enter GLOUCESTER


GLOUCESTER

The king is in high rage.

CORNWALL

Whither is he going?

GLOUCESTER

He calls to horse; but will I know not whither.

CORNWALL

'Tis best to give him way; he leads himself.

GONERIL

My lord, entreat him by no means to stay.

GLOUCESTER

Alack, the night comes on, and the bleak windsDo sorely ruffle; for many miles a boutThere's scarce a bush.

REGAN

O, sir, to wilful men,The injuries that they themselves procureMust be their schoolmasters. Shut up your doors:He is attended with a desperate train;And what they may incense him to, being aptTo have his ear abused, wisdom bids fear.

CORNWALL

Shut up your doors, my lord; 'tis a wild night:My Regan counsels well; come out o' the storm.Exeunt

ACT III
SCENE I. A heath.

Storm still. Enter KENT and a Gentleman, meeting


KENT

Who's there, besides foul weather?

Gentleman

One minded like the weather, most unquietly.

KENT

I know you. Where's the king?

Gentleman

Contending with the fretful element:Bids the winds blow the earth into the sea,Or swell the curled water 'bove the main,That things might change or cease; tears his white hair,Which the impetuous blasts, with eyeless rage,Catch in their fury, and make nothing of;Strives in his little world of man to out-scornThe to-and-fro-conflicting wind and rain.This night, wherein the cub-drawn bear would couch,The lion and the belly-pinched wolfKeep their fur dry, unbonneted he runs,And bids what will take all.

KENT

But who is with him?

Gentleman

None but the fool; who labours to out-jestHis heart-struck injuries.

KENT

Sir, I do know you;And dare, upon the warrant of my note,Commend a dear thing to you. There is division,Although as yet the face of it be cover'dWith mutual cunning, 'twixt Albany and Cornwall;Who have--as who have not, that their great starsThroned and set high?--servants, who seem no less,Which are to France the spies and speculationsIntelligent of our state; what hath been seen,Either in snuffs and packings of the dukes,Or the hard rein which both of them have borneAgainst the old kind king; or something deeper,Whereof perchance these are but furnishings;But, true it is, from France there comes a powerInto this scatter'd kingdom; who already,Wise in our negligence, have secret feetIn some of our best ports, and are at pointTo show their open banner. Now to you:If on my credit you dare build so farTo make your speed to Dover, you shall findSome that will thank you, making just reportOf how unnatural and bemadding sorrowThe king hath cause to plain.I am a gentleman of blood and breeding;And, from some knowledge and assurance, offerThis office to you.

Gentleman

I will talk further with you.

KENT

No, do not.For confirmation that I am much moreThan my out-wall, open this purse, and takeWhat it contains. If you shall see Cordelia,--As fear not but you shall,--show her this ring;And she will tell you who your fellow isThat yet you do not know. Fie on this storm!I will go seek the king.

Gentleman

Give me your hand: have you no more to say?

KENT

Few words, but, to effect, more than all yet;That, when we have found the king,--in which your painThat way, I'll this,--he that first lights on himHolla the other.Exeunt severally

SCENE II. Another part of the heath. Storm still.

Enter KING LEAR and Fool


KING LEAR

Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks! rage! blow!You cataracts and hurricanoes, spoutTill you have drench'd our steeples, drown'd the cocks!You sulphurous and thought-executing fires,Vaunt-couriers to oak-cleaving thunderbolts,Singe my white head! And thou, all-shaking thunder,Smite flat the thick rotundity o' the world!Crack nature's moulds, an germens spill at once,That make ingrateful man!

Fool

O nuncle, court holy-water in a dryhouse is better than this rain-water out o' door.Good nuncle, in, and ask thy daughters' blessing:here's a night pities neither wise man nor fool.

KING LEAR

Rumble thy bellyful! Spit, fire! spout, rain!Nor rain, wind, thunder, fire, are my daughters:I tax not you, you elements, with unkindness;I never gave you kingdom, call'd you children,You owe me no subscription: then let fallYour horrible pleasure: here I stand, your slave,A poor, infirm, weak, and despised old man:But yet I call you servile ministers,That have with two pernicious daughters join'dYour high engender'd battles 'gainst a headSo old and white as this. O! O! 'tis foul!

Fool

He that has a house to put's head in has a goodhead-piece.The cod-piece that will houseBefore the head has any,The head and he shall louse;So beggars marry many.The man that makes his toeWhat he his heart should makeShall of a corn cry woe,And turn his sleep to wake.For there was never yet fair woman but she mademouths in a glass.

KING LEAR

No, I will be the pattern of all patience;I will say nothing.Enter KENT


KENT

Who's there?

Fool

Marry, here's grace and a cod-piece; that's a wiseman and a fool.

KENT

Alas, sir, are you here? things that love nightLove not such nights as these; the wrathful skiesGallow the very wanderers of the dark,And make them keep their caves: since I was man,Such sheets of fire, such bursts of horrid thunder,Such groans of roaring wind and rain, I neverRemember to have heard: man's nature cannot carryThe affliction nor the fear.

KING LEAR

Let the great gods,That keep this dreadful pother o'er our heads,Find out their enemies now. Tremble, thou wretch,That hast within thee undivulged crimes,Unwhipp'd of justice: hide thee, thou bloody hand;Thou perjured, and thou simular man of virtueThat art incestuous: caitiff, to pieces shake,That under covert and convenient seemingHast practised on man's life: close pent-up guilts,Rive your concealing continents, and cryThese dreadful summoners grace. I am a manMore sinn'd against than sinning.

KENT

Alack, bare-headed!Gracious my lord, hard by here is a hovel;Some friendship will it lend you 'gainst the tempest:Repose you there; while I to this hard house--More harder than the stones whereof 'tis raised;Which even but now, demanding after you,Denied me to come in--return, and forceTheir scanted courtesy.

KING LEAR

My wits begin to turn.Come on, my boy: how dost, my boy? art cold?I am cold myself. Where is this straw, my fellow?The art of our necessities is strange,That can make vile things precious. Come,your hovel.Poor fool and knave, I have one part in my heartThat's sorry yet for thee.

Fool

[Singing]He that has and a little tiny wit--With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,--Must make content with his fortunes fit,For the rain it raineth every day.

KING LEAR

True, my good boy. Come, bring us to this hovel.Exeunt KING LEAR and KENT


Fool

This is a brave night to cool a courtezan.I'll speak a prophecy ere I go:When priests are more in word than matter;When brewers mar their malt with water;When nobles are their tailors' tutors;No heretics burn'd, but wenches' suitors;When every case in law is right;No squire in debt, nor no poor knight;When slanders do not live in tongues;Nor cutpurses come not to throngs;When usurers tell their gold i' the field;And bawds and whores do churches build;Then shall the realm of AlbionCome to great confusion:Then comes the time, who lives to see't,That going shall be used with feet.This prophecy Merlin shall make; for I live before his time.Exit

SCENE III. Gloucester's castle.

Enter GLOUCESTER and EDMUND


GLOUCESTER

Alack, alack, Edmund, I like not this unnaturaldealing. When I desire their leave that I mightpity him, they took from me the use of mine ownhouse; charged me, on pain of their perpetualdispleasure, neither to speak of him, entreat forhim, nor any way sustain him.

EDMUND

Most savage and unnatural!

GLOUCESTER

Go to; say you nothing. There's a division betwixtthe dukes; and a worse matter than that: I havereceived a letter this night; 'tis dangerous to bespoken; I have locked the letter in my closet:these injuries the king now bears will be revengedhome; there's part of a power already footed: wemust incline to the king. I will seek him, andprivily relieve him: go you and maintain talk withthe duke, that my charity be not of him perceived:if he ask for me. I am ill, and gone to bed.Though I die for it, as no less is threatened me,the king my old master must be relieved. There issome strange thing toward, Edmund; pray you, be careful.Exit


EDMUND

This courtesy, forbid thee, shall the dukeInstantly know; and of that letter too:This seems a fair deserving, and must draw meThat which my father loses; no less than all:The younger rises when the old doth fall.Exit

SCENE IV. The heath. Before a hovel.

Enter KING LEAR, KENT, and Fool


KENT

Here is the place, my lord; good my lord, enter:The tyranny of the open night's too roughFor nature to endure.Storm still


KING LEAR

Let me alone.

KENT

Good my lord, enter here.

KING LEAR

Wilt break my heart?

KENT

I had rather break mine own. Good my lord, enter.

KING LEAR

Thou think'st 'tis much that this contentious stormInvades us to the skin: so 'tis to thee;But where the greater malady is fix'd,The lesser is scarce felt. Thou'ldst shun a bear;But if thy flight lay toward the raging sea,Thou'ldst meet the bear i' the mouth. When themind's free,The body's delicate: the tempest in my mindDoth from my senses take all feeling elseSave what beats there. Filial ingratitude!Is it not as this mouth should tear this handFor lifting food to't? But I will punish home:No, I will weep no more. In such a nightTo shut me out! Pour on; I will endure.In such a night as this! O Regan, Goneril!Your old kind father, whose frank heart gave all,--O, that way madness lies; let me shun that;No more of that.

KENT

                  Good my lord, enter here.

KING LEAR

Prithee, go in thyself: seek thine own ease:This tempest will not give me leave to ponderOn things would hurt me more. But I'll go in.To the Fool
In, boy; go first. You houseless poverty,--Nay, get thee in. I'll pray, and then I'll sleep.Fool goes in
Poor naked wretches, whereso'er you are,That bide the pelting of this pitiless storm,How shall your houseless heads and unfed sides,Your loop'd and window'd raggedness, defend youFrom seasons such as these? O, I have ta'enToo little care of this! Take physic, pomp;Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel,That thou mayst shake the superflux to them,And show the heavens more just.

EDGAR

[Within]  Fathom and half, fathom and half! Poor Tom!The Fool runs out from the hovel


Fool

Come not in here, nuncle, here's a spiritHelp me, help me!

KENT

Give me thy hand. Who's there?

Fool

A spirit, a spirit: he says his name's poor Tom.

KENT

What art thou that dost grumble there i' the straw?Come forth.Enter EDGAR disguised as a mad man


EDGAR

Away! the foul fiend follows me!Through the sharp hawthorn blows the cold wind.Hum! go to thy cold bed, and warm thee.

KING LEAR

Hast thou given all to thy two daughters?And art thou come to this?

EDGAR

Who gives any thing to poor Tom? whom the foulfiend hath led through fire and through flame, andthrough ford and whirlipool e'er bog and quagmire;that hath laid knives under his pillow, and haltersin his pew; set ratsbane by his porridge; made filmproud of heart, to ride on a bay trotting-horse overfour-inched bridges, to course his own shadow for atraitor. Bless thy five wits! Tom's a-cold,--O, dode, do de, do de. Bless thee from whirlwinds,star-blasting, and taking! Do poor Tom somecharity, whom the foul fiend vexes: there could Ihave him now,--and there,--and there again, and there.Storm still


KING LEAR

What, have his daughters brought him to this pass?Couldst thou save nothing? Didst thou give them all?

Fool

Nay, he reserved a blanket, else we had been all shamed.

KING LEAR

Now, all the plagues that in the pendulous airHang fated o'er men's faults light on thy daughters!

KENT

He hath no daughters, sir.

KING LEAR

Death, traitor! nothing could have subdued natureTo such a lowness but his unkind daughters.Is it the fashion, that discarded fathersShould have thus little mercy on their flesh?Judicious punishment! 'twas this flesh begotThose pelican daughters.

EDGAR

Pillicock sat on Pillicock-hill:Halloo, halloo, loo, loo!

Fool

This cold night will turn us all to fools and madmen.

EDGAR

Take heed o' the foul fiend: obey thy parents;keep thy word justly; swear not; commit not withman's sworn spouse; set not thy sweet heart on proudarray. Tom's a-cold.

KING LEAR

What hast thou been?

EDGAR

A serving-man, proud in heart and mind; that curledmy hair; wore gloves in my cap; served the lust ofmy mistress' heart, and did the act of darkness withher; swore as many oaths as I spake words, andbroke them in the sweet face of heaven: one thatslept in the contriving of lust, and waked to do it:wine loved I deeply, dice dearly: and in womanout-paramoured the Turk: false of heart, light ofear, bloody of hand; hog in sloth, fox in stealth,wolf in greediness, dog in madness, lion in prey.Let not the creaking of shoes nor the rustling ofsilks betray thy poor heart to woman: keep thy footout of brothels, thy hand out of plackets, thy penfrom lenders' books, and defy the foul fiend.Still through the hawthorn blows the cold wind:Says suum, mun, ha, no, nonny.Dolphin my boy, my boy, sessa! let him trot by.Storm still


KING LEAR

Why, thou wert better in thy grave than to answerwith thy uncovered body this extremity of the skies.Is man no more than this? Consider him well. Thouowest the worm no silk, the beast no hide, the sheepno wool, the cat no perfume. Ha! here's three on's are sophisticated! Thou art the thing itself:unaccommodated man is no more but such a poor bare,forked animal as thou art. Off, off, you lendings!come unbutton here.Tearing off his clothes


Fool

Prithee, nuncle, be contented; 'tis a naughty nightto swim in. Now a little fire in a wild field werelike an old lecher's heart; a small spark, all therest on's body cold. Look, here comes a walking fire.Enter GLOUCESTER, with a torch


EDGAR

This is the foul fiend Flibbertigibbet: he beginsat curfew, and walks till the first cock; he givesthe web and the pin, squints the eye, and makes thehare-lip; mildews the white wheat, and hurts thepoor creature of earth.S. Withold footed thrice the old;He met the night-mare, and her nine-fold;Bid her alight,And her troth plight,And, aroint thee, witch, aroint thee!

KENT

How fares your grace?

KING LEAR

What's he?

KENT

Who's there? What is't you seek?

GLOUCESTER

What are you there? Your names?

EDGAR

Poor Tom; that eats the swimming frog, the toad,the tadpole, the wall-newt and the water; that inthe fury of his heart, when the foul fiend rages,eats cow-dung for sallets; swallows the old rat andthe ditch-dog; drinks the green mantle of thestanding pool; who is whipped from tithing totithing, and stock- punished, and imprisoned; whohath had three suits to his back, six shirts to hisbody, horse to ride, and weapon to wear;But mice and rats, and such small deer,Have been Tom's food for seven long year.Beware my follower. Peace, Smulkin; peace, thou fiend!

GLOUCESTER

What, hath your grace no better company?

EDGAR

The prince of darkness is a gentleman:Modo he's call'd, and Mahu.

GLOUCESTER

Our flesh and blood is grown so vile, my lord,That it doth hate what gets it.

EDGAR

Poor Tom's a-cold.

GLOUCESTER

Go in with me: my duty cannot sufferTo obey in all your daughters' hard commands:Though their injunction be to bar my doors,And let this tyrannous night take hold upon you,Yet have I ventured to come seek you out,And bring you where both fire and food is ready.

KING LEAR

First let me talk with this philosopher.What is the cause of thunder?

KENT

Good my lord, take his offer; go into the house.

KING LEAR

I'll talk a word with this same learned Theban.What is your study?

EDGAR

How to prevent the fiend, and to kill vermin.

KING LEAR

Let me ask you one word in private.

KENT

Importune him once more to go, my lord;His wits begin to unsettle.

GLOUCESTER

Canst thou blame him?Storm still
His daughters seek his death: ah, that good Kent!He said it would be thus, poor banish'd man!Thou say'st the king grows mad; I'll tell thee, friend,I am almost mad myself: I had a son,Now outlaw'd from my blood; he sought my life,But lately, very late: I loved him, friend;No father his son dearer: truth to tell thee,The grief hath crazed my wits. What a night's this!I do beseech your grace,--

KING LEAR

O, cry your mercy, sir.Noble philosopher, your company.

EDGAR

Tom's a-cold.

GLOUCESTER

In, fellow, there, into the hovel: keep thee warm.

KING LEAR

Come let's in all.

KENT

                  This way, my lord.

KING LEAR

With him;I will keep still with my philosopher.

KENT

Good my lord, soothe him; let him take the fellow.

GLOUCESTER

Take him you on.

KENT

Sirrah, come on; go along with us.

KING LEAR

Come, good Athenian.

GLOUCESTER

No words, no words: hush.

EDGAR

      Child Rowland to the dark tower came,His word was still,--Fie, foh, and fum,I smell the blood of a British man.Exeunt

SCENE V. Gloucester's castle.

Enter CORNWALL and EDMUND


CORNWALL

I will have my revenge ere I depart his house.

EDMUND

How, my lord, I may be censured, that nature thusgives way to loyalty, something fears me to thinkof.

CORNWALL

I now perceive, it was not altogether yourbrother's evil disposition made him seek his death;but a provoking merit, set a-work by a reprovablebadness in himself.

EDMUND

How malicious is my fortune, that I must repent tobe just! This is the letter he spoke of, whichapproves him an intelligent party to the advantagesof France: O heavens! that this treason were not,or not I the detector!

CORNWALL

o with me to the duchess.

EDMUND

If the matter of this paper be certain, you havemighty business in hand.

CORNWALL

True or false, it hath made thee earl ofGloucester. Seek out where thy father is, that hemay be ready for our apprehension.

EDMUND

[Aside]  If I find him comforting the king, it willstuff his suspicion more fully.--I will persevere inmy course of loyalty, though the conflict be sorebetween that and my blood.

CORNWALL

I will lay trust upon thee; and thou shalt find adearer father in my love.Exeunt

SCENE VI. A chamber in a farmhouse adjoining the castle.

Enter GLOUCESTER, KING LEAR, KENT, Fool, and EDGAR


GLOUCESTER

Here is better than the open air; take itthankfully. I will piece out the comfort with whataddition I can: I will not be long from you.

KENT

All the power of his wits have given way to hisimpatience: the gods reward your kindness!Exit GLOUCESTER


EDGAR

Frateretto calls me; and tells meNero is an angler in the lake of darkness.Pray, innocent, and beware the foul fiend.

Fool

Prithee, nuncle, tell me whether a madman be agentleman or a yeoman?

KING LEAR

A king, a king!

Fool

No, he's a yeoman that has a gentleman to his son;for he's a mad yeoman that sees his son a gentlemanbefore him.

KING LEAR

To have a thousand with red burning spitsCome hissing in upon 'em,--

EDGAR

The foul fiend bites my back.

Fool

He's mad that trusts in the tameness of a wolf, ahorse's health, a boy's love, or a whore's oath.

KING LEAR

It shall be done; I will arraign them straight.To EDGAR
Come, sit thou here, most learned justicer;To the Fool
Thou, sapient sir, sit here. Now, you she foxes!

EDGAR

   Look, where he stands and glares!Wantest thou eyes at trial, madam?Come o'er the bourn, Bessy, to me,--

Fool

   Her boat hath a leak,And she must not speakWhy she dares not come over to thee.

EDGAR

The foul fiend haunts poor Tom in the voice of anightingale. Hopdance cries in Tom's belly for twowhite herring. Croak not, black angel; I have nofood for thee.

KENT

How do you, sir? Stand you not so amazed:Will you lie down and rest upon the cushions?

KING LEAR

I'll see their trial first. Bring in the evidence.To EDGAR
Thou robed man of justice, take thy place;To the Fool
And thou, his yoke-fellow of equity,Bench by his side:To KENT
you are o' the commission,Sit you too.

EDGAR

Let us deal justly.Sleepest or wakest thou, jolly shepherd?Thy sheep be in the corn;And for one blast of thy minikin mouth,Thy sheep shall take no harm.Pur! the cat is gray.

KING LEAR

Arraign her first; 'tis Goneril. I here take myoath before this honourable assembly, she kicked thepoor king her father.

Fool

Come hither, mistress. Is your name Goneril?

KING LEAR

She cannot deny it.

Fool

Cry you mercy, I took you for a joint-stool.

KING LEAR

And here's another, whose warp'd looks proclaimWhat store her heart is made on. Stop her there!Arms, arms, sword, fire! Corruption in the place!False justicer, why hast thou let her 'scape?

EDGAR

Bless thy five wits!

KENT

O pity! Sir, where is the patience now,That thou so oft have boasted to retain?

EDGAR

[Aside]  My tears begin to take his part so much,They'll mar my counterfeiting.

KING LEAR

The little dogs and all, Tray, Blanch, andSweet-heart, see, they bark at me.

EDGAR

Tom will throw his head at them. Avaunt, you curs!Be thy mouth or black or white,Tooth that poisons if it bite;Mastiff, grey-hound, mongrel grim,Hound or spaniel, brach or lym,Or bobtail tike or trundle-tail,Tom will make them weep and wail:For, with throwing thus my head,Dogs leap the hatch, and all are fled.Do de, de, de. Sessa! Come, march to wakes andfairs and market-towns. Poor Tom, thy horn is dry.

KING LEAR

Then let them anatomize Regan; see what breedsabout her heart. Is there any cause in nature thatmakes these hard hearts?To EDGAR
You, sir, I entertain for one of my hundred; only Ido not like the fashion of your garments: you willsay they are Persian attire: but let them be changed.

KENT

Now, good my lord, lie here and rest awhile.

KING LEAR

Make no noise, make no noise; draw the curtains:so, so, so. We'll go to supper i' he morning. So, so, so.

Fool

And I'll go to bed at noon.Re-enter GLOUCESTER


GLOUCESTER

Come hither, friend: where is the king my master?

KENT

Here, sir; but trouble him not, his wits are gone.

GLOUCESTER

Good friend, I prithee, take him in thy arms;I have o'erheard a plot of death upon him:There is a litter ready; lay him in 't,And drive towards Dover, friend, where thou shalt meetBoth welcome and protection. Take up thy master:If thou shouldst dally half an hour, his life,With thine, and all that offer to defend him,Stand in assured loss: take up, take up;And follow me, that will to some provisionGive thee quick conduct.

KENT

Oppressed nature sleeps:This rest might yet have balm'd thy broken senses,Which, if convenience will not allow,Stand in hard cure.To the Fool
Come, help to bear thy master;Thou must not stay behind.

GLOUCESTER

Come, come, away.Exeunt all but EDGAR


EDGAR

When we our betters see bearing our woes,We scarcely think our miseries our foes.Who alone suffers suffers most i' the mind,Leaving free things and happy shows behind:But then the mind much sufferance doth o'er skip,When grief hath mates, and bearing fellowship.How light and portable my pain seems now,When that which makes me bend makes the king bow,He childed as I father'd! Tom, away!Mark the high noises; and thyself bewray,When false opinion, whose wrong thought defiles thee,In thy just proof, repeals and reconciles thee.What will hap more to-night, safe 'scape the king!Lurk, lurk.Exit

SCENE VII. Gloucester's castle.

Enter CORNWALL, REGAN, GONERIL, EDMUND, and Servants


CORNWALL

Post speedily to my lord your husband; show himthis letter: the army of France is landed. Seekout the villain Gloucester.Exeunt some of the Servants


REGAN

Hang him instantly.

GONERIL

Pluck out his eyes.

CORNWALL

Leave him to my displeasure. Edmund, keep you oursister company: the revenges we are bound to takeupon your traitorous father are not fit for yourbeholding. Advise the duke, where you are going, toa most festinate preparation: we are bound to thelike. Our posts shall be swift and intelligentbetwixt us. Farewell, dear sister: farewell, mylord of Gloucester.Enter OSWALD
How now! where's the king?

OSWALD

My lord of Gloucester hath convey'd him hence:Some five or six and thirty of his knights,Hot questrists after him, met him at gate;Who, with some other of the lords dependants,Are gone with him towards Dover; where they boastTo have well-armed friends.

CORNWALL

Get horses for your mistress.

GONERIL

Farewell, sweet lord, and sister.

CORNWALL

Edmund, farewell.Exeunt GONERIL, EDMUND, and OSWALD
Go seek the traitor Gloucester,Pinion him like a thief, bring him before us.Exeunt other Servants
Though well we may not pass upon his lifeWithout the form of justice, yet our powerShall do a courtesy to our wrath, which menMay blame, but not control. Who's there? the traitor?Enter GLOUCESTER, brought in by two or three


REGAN

Ingrateful fox! 'tis he.

CORNWALL

Bind fast his corky arms.

GLOUCESTER

What mean your graces? Good my friends, considerYou are my guests: do me no foul play, friends.

CORNWALL

Bind him, I say.Servants bind him


REGAN

                  Hard, hard. O filthy traitor!

GLOUCESTER

Unmerciful lady as you are, I'm none.

CORNWALL

To this chair bind him. Villain, thou shalt find--REGAN plucks his beard


GLOUCESTER

By the kind gods, 'tis most ignobly doneTo pluck me by the beard.

REGAN

So white, and such a traitor!

GLOUCESTER

Naughty lady,These hairs, which thou dost ravish from my chin,Will quicken, and accuse thee: I am your host:With robbers' hands my hospitable favoursYou should not ruffle thus. What will you do?

CORNWALL

Come, sir, what letters had you late from France?

REGAN

Be simple answerer, for we know the truth.

CORNWALL

And what confederacy have you with the traitorsLate footed in the kingdom?

REGAN

To whose hands have you sent the lunatic king? Speak.

GLOUCESTER

I have a letter guessingly set down,Which came from one that's of a neutral heart,And not from one opposed.

CORNWALL

Cunning.

REGAN

And false.

CORNWALL

Where hast thou sent the king?

GLOUCESTER

To Dover.

REGAN

Wherefore to Dover? Wast thou not charged at peril--

CORNWALL

Wherefore to Dover? Let him first answer that.

GLOUCESTER

I am tied to the stake, and I must stand the course.

REGAN

Wherefore to Dover, sir?

GLOUCESTER

Because I would not see thy cruel nailsPluck out his poor old eyes; nor thy fierce sisterIn his anointed flesh stick boarish fangs.The sea, with such a storm as his bare headIn hell-black night endured, would have buoy'd up,And quench'd the stelled fires:Yet, poor old heart, he holp the heavens to rain.If wolves had at thy gate howl'd that stern time,Thou shouldst have said 'Good porter, turn the key,'All cruels else subscribed: but I shall seeThe winged vengeance overtake such children.

CORNWALL

See't shalt thou never. Fellows, hold the chair.Upon these eyes of thine I'll set my foot.

GLOUCESTER

He that will think to live till he be old,Give me some help! O cruel! O you gods!

REGAN

One side will mock another; the other too.

CORNWALL

If you see vengeance,--

First Servant

Hold your hand, my lord:I have served you ever since I was a child;But better service have I never done youThan now to bid you hold.

REGAN

How now, you dog!

First Servant

If you did wear a beard upon your chin,I'd shake it on this quarrel. What do you mean?

CORNWALL

My villain!They draw and fight


First Servant

Nay, then, come on, and take the chance of anger.

REGAN

Give me thy sword. A peasant stand up thus!Takes a sword, and runs at him behind


First Servant

O, I am slain! My lord, you have one eye leftTo see some mischief on him. O!Dies


CORNWALL

Lest it see more, prevent it. Out, vile jelly!Where is thy lustre now?

GLOUCESTER

All dark and comfortless. Where's my son Edmund?Edmund, enkindle all the sparks of nature,To quit this horrid act.

REGAN

Out, treacherous villain!Thou call'st on him that hates thee: it was heThat made the overture of thy treasons to us;Who is too good to pity thee.

GLOUCESTER

O my follies! then Edgar was abused.Kind gods, forgive me that, and prosper him!

REGAN

Go thrust him out at gates, and let him smellHis way to Dover.Exit one with GLOUCESTER
How is't, my lord? how look you?

CORNWALL

I have received a hurt: follow me, lady.Turn out that eyeless villain; throw this slaveUpon the dunghill. Regan, I bleed apace:Untimely comes this hurt: give me your arm.Exit CORNWALL, led by REGAN


Second Servant

I'll never care what wickedness I do,If this man come to good.

Third Servant

If she live long,And in the end meet the old course of death,Women will all turn monsters.

Second Servant

Let's follow the old earl, and get the BedlamTo lead him where he would: his roguish madnessAllows itself to any thing.

Third Servant

Go thou: I'll fetch some flax and whites of eggsTo apply to his bleeding face. Now, heaven help him!Exeunt severally

ACT IV
SCENE I. The heath.

Enter EDGAR


EDGAR

Yet better thus, and known to be contemn'd,Than still contemn'd and flatter'd. To be worst,The lowest and most dejected thing of fortune,Stands still in esperance, lives not in fear:The lamentable change is from the best;The worst returns to laughter. Welcome, then,Thou unsubstantial air that I embrace!The wretch that thou hast blown unto the worstOwes nothing to thy blasts. But who comes here?Enter GLOUCESTER, led by an Old Man
My father, poorly led? World, world, O world!But that thy strange mutations make us hate thee,Lie would not yield to age.

Old Man

O, my good lord, I have been your tenant, andyour father's tenant, these fourscore years.

GLOUCESTER

Away, get thee away; good friend, be gone:Thy comforts can do me no good at all;Thee they may hurt.

Old Man

Alack, sir, you cannot see your way.

GLOUCESTER

I have no way, and therefore want no eyes;I stumbled when I saw: full oft 'tis seen,Our means secure us, and our mere defectsProve our commodities. O dear son Edgar,The food of thy abused father's wrath!Might I but live to see thee in my touch,I'ld say I had eyes again!

Old Man

How now! Who's there?

EDGAR

[Aside]  O gods! Who is't can say 'I am atthe worst'?I am worse than e'er I was.

Old Man

'Tis poor mad Tom.

EDGAR

[Aside]  And worse I may be yet: the worst is notSo long as we can say  'This is the worst.'

Old Man

Fellow, where goest?

GLOUCESTER

Is it a beggar-man?

Old Man

Madman and beggar too.

GLOUCESTER

He has some reason, else he could not beg.I' the last night's storm I such a fellow saw;Which made me think a man a worm: my sonCame then into my mind; and yet my mindWas then scarce friends with him: I have heardmore since.As flies to wanton boys, are we to the gods.They kill us for their sport.

EDGAR

[Aside]	How should this be?Bad is the trade that must play fool to sorrow,Angering itself and others.--Bless thee, master!

GLOUCESTER

Is that the naked fellow?

Old Man

Ay, my lord.

GLOUCESTER

Then, prithee, get thee gone: if, for my sake,Thou wilt o'ertake us, hence a mile or twain,I' the way toward Dover, do it for ancient love;And bring some covering for this naked soul,Who I'll entreat to lead me.

Old Man

Alack, sir, he is mad.

GLOUCESTER

'Tis the times' plague, when madmen lead the blind.Do as I bid thee, or rather do thy pleasure;Above the rest, be gone.

Old Man

I'll bring him the best 'parel that I have,Come on't what will.Exit


GLOUCESTER

Sirrah, naked fellow,--

EDGAR

Poor Tom's a-cold.Aside
I cannot daub it further.

GLOUCESTER

Come hither, fellow.

EDGAR

[Aside]  And yet I must.--Bless thy sweet eyes, they bleed.

GLOUCESTER

Know'st thou the way to Dover?

EDGAR

Both stile and gate, horse-way and foot-path. PoorTom hath been scared out of his good wits: blessthee, good man's son, from the foul fiend! fivefiends have been in poor Tom at once; of lust, asObidicut; Hobbididence, prince of dumbness; Mahu, ofstealing; Modo, of murder; Flibbertigibbet, ofmopping and mowing, who since possesses chambermaidsand waiting-women. So, bless thee, master!

GLOUCESTER

Here, take this purse, thou whom the heavens' plaguesHave humbled to all strokes: that I am wretchedMakes thee the happier: heavens, deal so still!Let the superfluous and lust-dieted man,That slaves your ordinance, that will not seeBecause he doth not feel, feel your power quickly;So distribution should undo excess,And each man have enough. Dost thou know Dover?

EDGAR

Ay, master.

GLOUCESTER

There is a cliff, whose high and bending headLooks fearfully in the confined deep:Bring me but to the very brim of it,And I'll repair the misery thou dost bearWith something rich about me: from that placeI shall no leading need.

EDGAR

Give me thy arm:Poor Tom shall lead thee.Exeunt

SCENE II. Before ALBANY's palace.

Enter GONERIL and EDMUND


GONERIL

Welcome, my lord: I marvel our mild husbandNot met us on the way.Enter OSWALD
Now, where's your master'?

OSWALD

Madam, within; but never man so changed.I told him of the army that was landed;He smiled at it: I told him you were coming:His answer was 'The worse:' of Gloucester's treachery,And of the loyal service of his son,When I inform'd him, then he call'd me sot,And told me I had turn'd the wrong side out:What most he should dislike seems pleasant to him;What like, offensive.

GONERIL

[To EDMUND]  Then shall you go no further.It is the cowish terror of his spirit,That dares not undertake: he'll not feel wrongsWhich tie him to an answer. Our wishes on the wayMay prove effects. Back, Edmund, to my brother;Hasten his musters and conduct his powers:I must change arms at home, and give the distaffInto my husband's hands. This trusty servantShall pass between us: ere long you are like to hear,If you dare venture in your own behalf,A mistress's command. Wear this; spare speech;Giving a favour
Decline your head: this kiss, if it durst speak,Would stretch thy spirits up into the air:Conceive, and fare thee well.

EDMUND

Yours in the ranks of death.

GONERIL

My most dear Gloucester!Exit EDMUND
O, the difference of man and man!To thee a woman's services are due:My fool usurps my body.

OSWALD

Madam, here comes my lord.Exit
Enter ALBANY


GONERIL

I have been worth the whistle.

ALBANY

O Goneril!You are not worth the dust which the rude windBlows in your face. I fear your disposition:That nature, which contemns its origin,Cannot be border'd certain in itself;She that herself will sliver and disbranchFrom her material sap, perforce must witherAnd come to deadly use.

GONERIL

No more; the text is foolish.

ALBANY

Wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile:Filths savour but themselves. What have you done?Tigers, not daughters, what have you perform'd?A father, and a gracious aged man,Whose reverence even the head-lugg'd bear would lick,Most barbarous, most degenerate! have you madded.Could my good brother suffer you to do it?A man, a prince, by him so benefited!If that the heavens do not their visible spiritsSend quickly down to tame these vile offences,It will come,Humanity must perforce prey on itself,Like monsters of the deep.

GONERIL

Milk-liver'd man!That bear'st a cheek for blows, a head for wrongs;Who hast not in thy brows an eye discerningThine honour from thy suffering; that not know'stFools do those villains pity who are punish'dEre they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?France spreads his banners in our noiseless land;With plumed helm thy slayer begins threats;Whiles thou, a moral fool, sit'st still, and criest'Alack, why does he so?'

ALBANY

See thyself, devil!Proper deformity seems not in the fiendSo horrid as in woman.

GONERIL

O vain fool!

ALBANY

Thou changed and self-cover'd thing, for shame,Be-monster not thy feature. Were't my fitnessTo let these hands obey my blood,They are apt enough to dislocate and tearThy flesh and bones: howe'er thou art a fiend,A woman's shape doth shield thee.

GONERIL

Marry, your manhood now--Enter a Messenger


ALBANY

What news?

Messenger

O, my good lord, the Duke of Cornwall's dead:Slain by his servant, going to put outThe other eye of Gloucester.

ALBANY

Gloucester's eye!

Messenger

A servant that he bred, thrill'd with remorse,Opposed against the act, bending his swordTo his great master; who, thereat enraged,Flew on him, and amongst them fell'd him dead;But not without that harmful stroke, which sinceHath pluck'd him after.

ALBANY

This shows you are above,You justicers, that these our nether crimesSo speedily can venge! But, O poor Gloucester!Lost he his other eye?

Messenger

Both, both, my lord.This letter, madam, craves a speedy answer;'Tis from your sister.

GONERIL

[Aside]              One way I like this well;But being widow, and my Gloucester with her,May all the building in my fancy pluckUpon my hateful life: another way,The news is not so tart.--I'll read, and answer.Exit


ALBANY

Where was his son when they did take his eyes?

Messenger

Come with my lady hither.

ALBANY

He is not here.

Messenger

No, my good lord; I met him back again.

ALBANY

Knows he the wickedness?

Messenger

Ay, my good lord; 'twas he inform'd against him;And quit the house on purpose, that their punishmentMight have the freer course.

ALBANY

Gloucester, I liveTo thank thee for the love thou show'dst the king,And to revenge thine eyes. Come hither, friend:Tell me what more thou know'st.Exeunt

SCENE III. The French camp near Dover.

Enter KENT and a Gentleman


KENT

Why the King of France is so suddenly gone backknow you the reason?

Gentleman

Something he left imperfect in thestate, which since his coming forth is thoughtof; which imports to the kingdom so muchfear and danger, that his personal return wasmost required and necessary.

KENT

Who hath he left behind him general?

Gentleman

The Marshal of France, Monsieur La Far.

KENT

Did your letters pierce the queen to anydemonstration of grief?

Gentleman

Ay, sir; she took them, read them in my presence;And now and then an ample tear trill'd downHer delicate cheek: it seem'd she was a queenOver her passion; who, most rebel-like,Sought to be king o'er her.

KENT

O, then it moved her.

Gentleman

Not to a rage: patience and sorrow stroveWho should express her goodliest. You have seenSunshine and rain at once: her smiles and tearsWere like a better way: those happy smilets,That play'd on her ripe lip, seem'd not to knowWhat guests were in her eyes; which parted thence,As pearls from diamonds dropp'd. In brief,Sorrow would be a rarity most beloved,If all could so become it.

KENT

Made she no verbal question?

Gentleman

'Faith, once or twice she heaved the name of 'father'Pantingly forth, as if it press'd her heart:Cried 'Sisters! sisters! Shame of ladies! sisters!Kent! father! sisters! What, i' the storm? i' the night?Let pity not be believed!' There she shookThe holy water from her heavenly eyes,And clamour moisten'd: then away she startedTo deal with grief alone.

KENT

It is the stars,The stars above us, govern our conditions;Else one self mate and mate could not begetSuch different issues. You spoke not with her since?

Gentleman

No.

KENT

Was this before the king return'd?

Gentleman

No, since.

KENT

Well, sir, the poor distressed Lear's i' the town;Who sometime, in his better tune, remembersWhat we are come about, and by no meansWill yield to see his daughter.

Gentleman

Why, good sir?

KENT

A sovereign shame so elbows him: his own unkindness,That stripp'd her from his benediction, turn'd herTo foreign casualties, gave her dear rightsTo his dog-hearted daughters, these things stingHis mind so venomously, that burning shameDetains him from Cordelia.

Gentleman

Alack, poor gentleman!

KENT

Of Albany's and Cornwall's powers you heard not?

Gentleman

'Tis so, they are afoot.

KENT

Well, sir, I'll bring you to our master Lear,And leave you to attend him: some dear causeWill in concealment wrap me up awhile;When I am known aright, you shall not grieveLending me this acquaintance. I pray you, goAlong with me.Exeunt

SCENE IV. The same. A tent.

Enter, with drum and colours, CORDELIA, Doctor, and Soldiers


CORDELIA

Alack, 'tis he: why, he was met even nowAs mad as the vex'd sea; singing aloud;Crown'd with rank fumiter and furrow-weeds,With bur-docks, hemlock, nettles, cuckoo-flowers,Darnel, and all the idle weeds that growIn our sustaining corn. A century send forth;Search every acre in the high-grown field,And bring him to our eye.Exit an Officer
What can man's wisdomIn the restoring his bereaved sense?He that helps him take all my outward worth.

Doctor

There is means, madam:Our foster-nurse of nature is repose,The which he lacks; that to provoke in him,Are many simples operative, whose powerWill close the eye of anguish.

CORDELIA

All blest secrets,All you unpublish'd virtues of the earth,Spring with my tears! be aidant and remediateIn the good man's distress! Seek, seek for him;Lest his ungovern'd rage dissolve the lifeThat wants the means to lead it.Enter a Messenger


Messenger

News, madam;The British powers are marching hitherward.

CORDELIA

'Tis known before; our preparation standsIn expectation of them. O dear father,It is thy business that I go about;Therefore great FranceMy mourning and important tears hath pitied.No blown ambition doth our arms incite,But love, dear love, and our aged father's right:Soon may I hear and see him!Exeunt

SCENE V. Gloucester's castle.

Enter REGAN and OSWALD


REGAN

But are my brother's powers set forth?

OSWALD

Ay, madam.

REGAN

Himself in person there?

OSWALD

Madam, with much ado:Your sister is the better soldier.

REGAN

Lord Edmund spake not with your lord at home?

OSWALD

No, madam.

REGAN

What might import my sister's letter to him?

OSWALD

I know not, lady.

REGAN

'Faith, he is posted hence on serious matter.It was great ignorance, Gloucester's eyes being out,To let him live: where he arrives he movesAll hearts against us: Edmund, I think, is gone,In pity of his misery, to dispatchHis nighted life: moreover, to descryThe strength o' the enemy.

OSWALD

I must needs after him, madam, with my letter.

REGAN

Our troops set forth to-morrow: stay with us;The ways are dangerous.

OSWALD

I may not, madam:My lady charged my duty in this business.

REGAN

Why should she write to Edmund? Might not youTransport her purposes by word? Belike,Something--I know not what: I'll love thee much,Let me unseal the letter.

OSWALD

Madam, I had rather--

REGAN

I know your lady does not love her husband;I am sure of that: and at her late being hereShe gave strange oeillades and most speaking looksTo noble Edmund. I know you are of her bosom.

OSWALD

I, madam?

REGAN

I speak in understanding; you are; I know't:Therefore I do advise you, take this note:My lord is dead; Edmund and I have talk'd;And more convenient is he for my handThan for your lady's: you may gather more.If you do find him, pray you, give him this;And when your mistress hears thus much from you,I pray, desire her call her wisdom to her.So, fare you well.If you do chance to hear of that blind traitor,Preferment falls on him that cuts him off.

OSWALD

Would I could meet him, madam! I should showWhat party I do follow.

REGAN

Fare thee well.Exeunt

SCENE VI. Fields near Dover.

Enter GLOUCESTER, and EDGAR dressed like a peasant


GLOUCESTER

When shall we come to the top of that same hill?

EDGAR

You do climb up it now: look, how we labour.

GLOUCESTER

Methinks the ground is even.

EDGAR

Horrible steep.Hark, do you hear the sea?

GLOUCESTER

No, truly.

EDGAR

Why, then, your other senses grow imperfectBy your eyes' anguish.

GLOUCESTER

So may it be, indeed:Methinks thy voice is alter'd; and thou speak'stIn better phrase and matter than thou didst.

EDGAR

You're much deceived: in nothing am I changedBut in my garments.

GLOUCESTER

Methinks you're better spoken.

EDGAR

Come on, sir; here's the place: stand still. How fearfulAnd dizzy 'tis, to cast one's eyes so low!The crows and choughs that wing the midway airShow scarce so gross as beetles: half way downHangs one that gathers samphire, dreadful trade!Methinks he seems no bigger than his head:The fishermen, that walk upon the beach,Appear like mice; and yond tall anchoring bark,Diminish'd to her cock; her cock, a buoyAlmost too small for sight: the murmuring surge,That on the unnumber'd idle pebbles chafes,Cannot be heard so high. I'll look no more;Lest my brain turn, and the deficient sightTopple down headlong.

GLOUCESTER

Set me where you stand.

EDGAR

Give me your hand: you are now within a footOf the extreme verge: for all beneath the moonWould I not leap upright.

GLOUCESTER

Let go my hand.Here, friend, 's another purse; in it a jewelWell worth a poor man's taking: fairies and godsProsper it with thee! Go thou farther off;Bid me farewell, and let me hear thee going.

EDGAR

Now fare you well, good sir.

GLOUCESTER

With all my heart.

EDGAR

Why I do trifle thus with his despairIs done to cure it.

GLOUCESTER

[Kneeling]  O you mighty gods!This world I do renounce, and, in your sights,Shake patiently my great affliction off:If I could bear it longer, and not fallTo quarrel with your great opposeless wills,My snuff and loathed part of nature shouldBurn itself out. If Edgar live, O, bless him!Now, fellow, fare thee well.He falls forward


EDGAR

Gone, sir: farewell.And yet I know not how conceit may robThe treasury of life, when life itselfYields to the theft: had he been where he thought,By this, had thought been past. Alive or dead?Ho, you sir! friend! Hear you, sir! speak!Thus might he pass indeed: yet he revives.What are you, sir?

GLOUCESTER

                  Away, and let me die.

EDGAR

Hadst thou been aught but gossamer, feathers, air,So many fathom down precipitating,Thou'dst shiver'd like an egg: but thou dost breathe;Hast heavy substance; bleed'st not; speak'st; art sound.Ten masts at each make not the altitudeWhich thou hast perpendicularly fell:Thy life's a miracle. Speak yet again.

GLOUCESTER

But have I fall'n, or no?

EDGAR

From the dread summit of this chalky bourn.Look up a-height; the shrill-gorged lark so farCannot be seen or heard: do but look up.

GLOUCESTER

Alack, I have no eyes.Is wretchedness deprived that benefit,To end itself by death? 'Twas yet some comfort,When misery could beguile the tyrant's rage,And frustrate his proud will.

EDGAR

Give me your arm:Up: so. How is 't? Feel you your legs? You stand.

GLOUCESTER

Too well, too well.

EDGAR

This is above all strangeness.Upon the crown o' the cliff, what thing was thatWhich parted from you?

GLOUCESTER

A poor unfortunate beggar.

EDGAR

As I stood here below, methought his eyesWere two full moons; he had a thousand noses,Horns whelk'd and waved like the enridged sea:It was some fiend; therefore, thou happy father,Think that the clearest gods, who make them honoursOf men's impossibilities, have preserved thee.

GLOUCESTER

I do remember now: henceforth I'll bearAffliction till it do cry out itself'Enough, enough,' and die. That thing you speak of,I took it for a man; often 'twould say'The fiend, the fiend:' he led me to that place.

EDGAR

Bear free and patient thoughts. But who comes here?Enter KING LEAR, fantastically dressed with wild flowers
The safer sense will ne'er accommodateHis master thus.

KING LEAR

No, they cannot touch me for coining; I am theking himself.

EDGAR

O thou side-piercing sight!

KING LEAR

Nature's above art in that respect. There's yourpress-money. That fellow handles his bow like acrow-keeper: draw me a clothier's yard. Look,look, a mouse! Peace, peace; this piece of toastedcheese will do 't. There's my gauntlet; I'll proveit on a giant. Bring up the brown bills. O, wellflown, bird! i' the clout, i' the clout: hewgh!Give the word.

EDGAR

Sweet marjoram.

KING LEAR

Pass.

GLOUCESTER

I know that voice.

KING LEAR

Ha! Goneril, with a white beard! They flatteredme like a dog; and told me I had white hairs in mybeard ere the black ones were there. To say 'ay'and 'no' to every thing that I said!--'Ay' and 'no'too was no good divinity. When the rain came towet me once, and the wind to make me chatter; whenthe thunder would not peace at my bidding; there Ifound 'em, there I smelt 'em out. Go to, they arenot men o' their words: they told me I was everything; 'tis a lie, I am not ague-proof.

GLOUCESTER

The trick of that voice I do well remember:Is 't not the king?

KING LEAR

Ay, every inch a king:When I do stare, see how the subject quakes.I pardon that man's life. What was thy cause? Adultery?Thou shalt not die: die for adultery! No:The wren goes to 't, and the small gilded flyDoes lecher in my sight.Let copulation thrive; for Gloucester's bastard sonWas kinder to his father than my daughtersGot 'tween the lawful sheets.To 't, luxury, pell-mell! for I lack soldiers.Behold yond simpering dame,Whose face between her forks presages snow;That minces virtue, and does shake the headTo hear of pleasure's name;The fitchew, nor the soiled horse, goes to 'tWith a more riotous appetite.Down from the waist they are Centaurs,Though women all above:But to the girdle do the gods inherit,Beneath is all the fiends';There's hell, there's darkness, there's thesulphurous pit,Burning, scalding, stench, consumption; fie,fie, fie! pah, pah! Give me an ounce of civet,good apothecary, to sweeten my imagination:there's money for thee.

GLOUCESTER

O, let me kiss that hand!

KING LEAR

Let me wipe it first; it smells of mortality.

GLOUCESTER

O ruin'd piece of nature! This great worldShall so wear out to nought. Dost thou know me?

KING LEAR

I remember thine eyes well enough. Dost thou squinyat me? No, do thy worst, blind Cupid! I'll notlove. Read thou this challenge; mark but thepenning of it.

GLOUCESTER

Were all the letters suns, I could not see one.

EDGAR

I would not take this from report; it is,And my heart breaks at it.

KING LEAR

Read.

GLOUCESTER

What, with the case of eyes?

KING LEAR

O, ho, are you there with me? No eyes in yourhead, nor no money in your purse? Your eyes are ina heavy case, your purse in a light; yet you see howthis world goes.

GLOUCESTER

I see it feelingly.

KING LEAR

What, art mad? A man may see how this world goeswith no eyes. Look with thine ears: see how yondjustice rails upon yond simple thief. Hark, inthine ear: change places; and, handy-dandy, whichis the justice, which is the thief? Thou hast seena farmer's dog bark at a beggar?

GLOUCESTER

Ay, sir.

KING LEAR

And the creature run from the cur? There thoumightst behold the great image of authority: adog's obeyed in office.Thou rascal beadle, hold thy bloody hand!Why dost thou lash that whore? Strip thine own back;Thou hotly lust'st to use her in that kindFor which thou whipp'st her. The usurer hangs the cozener.Through tatter'd clothes small vices do appear;Robes and furr'd gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,And the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks:Arm it in rags, a pigmy's straw does pierce it.None does offend, none, I say, none; I'll able 'em:Take that of me, my friend, who have the powerTo seal the accuser's lips. Get thee glass eyes;And like a scurvy politician, seemTo see the things thou dost not. Now, now, now, now:Pull off my boots: harder, harder: so.

EDGAR

O, matter and impertinency mix'd! Reason in madness!

KING LEAR

If thou wilt weep my fortunes, take my eyes.I know thee well enough; thy name is Gloucester:Thou must be patient; we came crying hither:Thou know'st, the first time that we smell the air,We wawl and cry. I will preach to thee: mark.

GLOUCESTER

Alack, alack the day!

KING LEAR

When we are born, we cry that we are comeTo this great stage of fools: this a good block;It were a delicate stratagem, to shoeA troop of horse with felt: I'll put 't in proof;And when I have stol'n upon these sons-in-law,Then, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill!Enter a Gentleman, with Attendants


Gentleman

O, here he is: lay hand upon him. Sir,Your most dear daughter--

KING LEAR

No rescue? What, a prisoner? I am evenThe natural fool of fortune. Use me well;You shall have ransom. Let me have surgeons;I am cut to the brains.

Gentleman

You shall have any thing.

KING LEAR

No seconds? all myself?Why, this would make a man a man of salt,To use his eyes for garden water-pots,Ay, and laying autumn's dust.

Gentleman

Good sir,--

KING LEAR

I will die bravely, like a bridegroom. What!I will be jovial: come, come; I am a king,My masters, know you that.

Gentleman

You are a royal one, and we obey you.

KING LEAR

Then there's life in't. Nay, if you get it, youshall get it with running. Sa, sa, sa, sa.Exit running; Attendants follow


Gentleman

A sight most pitiful in the meanest wretch,Past speaking of in a king! Thou hast one daughter,Who redeems nature from the general curseWhich twain have brought her to.

EDGAR

Hail, gentle sir.

Gentleman

                  Sir, speed you: what's your will?

EDGAR

Do you hear aught, sir, of a battle toward?

Gentleman

Most sure and vulgar: every one hears that,Which can distinguish sound.

EDGAR

But, by your favour,How near's the other army?

Gentleman

Near and on speedy foot; the main descryStands on the hourly thought.

EDGAR

I thank you, sir: that's all.

Gentleman

Though that the queen on special cause is here,Her army is moved on.

EDGAR

I thank you, sir.Exit Gentleman


GLOUCESTER

You ever-gentle gods, take my breath from me:Let not my worser spirit tempt me againTo die before you please!

EDGAR

Well pray you, father.

GLOUCESTER

Now, good sir, what are you?

EDGAR

A most poor man, made tame to fortune's blows;Who, by the art of known and feeling sorrows,Am pregnant to good pity. Give me your hand,I'll lead you to some biding.

GLOUCESTER

Hearty thanks:The bounty and the benison of heavenTo boot, and boot!Enter OSWALD


OSWALD

A proclaim'd prize! Most happy!That eyeless head of thine was first framed fleshTo raise my fortunes. Thou old unhappy traitor,Briefly thyself remember: the sword is outThat must destroy thee.

GLOUCESTER

Now let thy friendly handPut strength enough to't.EDGAR interposes


OSWALD

Wherefore, bold peasant,Darest thou support a publish'd traitor? Hence;Lest that the infection of his fortune takeLike hold on thee. Let go his arm.

EDGAR

Ch'ill not let go, zir, without vurther 'casion.

OSWALD

Let go, slave, or thou diest!

EDGAR

Good gentleman, go your gait, and let poor volkpass. An chud ha' bin zwaggered out of my life,'twould not ha' bin zo long as 'tis by a vortnight.Nay, come not near th' old man; keep out, che vorye, or ise try whether your costard or my ballow bethe harder: ch'ill be plain with you.

OSWALD

Out, dunghill!

EDGAR

Ch'ill pick your teeth, zir: come; no matter voryour foins.They fight, and EDGAR knocks him down


OSWALD

Slave, thou hast slain me: villain, take my purse:If ever thou wilt thrive, bury my body;And give the letters which thou find'st about meTo Edmund earl of Gloucester; seek him outUpon the British party: O, untimely death!Dies


EDGAR

I know thee well: a serviceable villain;As duteous to the vices of thy mistressAs badness would desire.

GLOUCESTER

What, is he dead?

EDGAR

Sit you down, father; rest youLet's see these pockets: the letters that he speaks ofMay be my friends. He's dead; I am only sorryHe had no other death's-man. Let us see:Leave, gentle wax; and, manners, blame us not:To know our enemies' minds, we'ld rip their hearts;Their papers, is more lawful.Reads
'Let our reciprocal vows be remembered. You havemany opportunities to cut him off: if your willwant not, time and place will be fruitfully offered.There is nothing done, if he return the conqueror:then am I the prisoner, and his bed my goal; fromthe loathed warmth whereof deliver me, and supplythe place for your labour.'Your--wife, so I would say--'Affectionate servant,'GONERIL.'O undistinguish'd space of woman's will!A plot upon her virtuous husband's life;And the exchange my brother! Here, in the sands,Thee I'll rake up, the post unsanctifiedOf murderous lechers: and in the mature timeWith this ungracious paper strike the sightOf the death practised duke: for him 'tis wellThat of thy death and business I can tell.

GLOUCESTER

The king is mad: how stiff is my vile sense,That I stand up, and have ingenious feelingOf my huge sorrows! Better I were distract:So should my thoughts be sever'd from my griefs,And woes by wrong imaginations loseThe knowledge of themselves.

EDGAR

Give me your hand:Drum afar off
Far off, methinks, I hear the beaten drum:Come, father, I'll bestow you with a friend.Exeunt

SCENE VII. A tent in the French camp. LEAR on a bed asleep,

soft music playing; Gentleman, and others attending.Enter CORDELIA, KENT, and Doctor


CORDELIA

O thou good Kent, how shall I live and work,To match thy goodness? My life will be too short,And every measure fail me.

KENT

To be acknowledged, madam, is o'erpaid.All my reports go with the modest truth;Nor more nor clipp'd, but so.

CORDELIA

Be better suited:These weeds are memories of those worser hours:I prithee, put them off.

KENT

Pardon me, dear madam;Yet to be known shortens my made intent:My boon I make it, that you know me notTill time and I think meet.

CORDELIA

Then be't so, my good lord.To the Doctor
How does the king?

Doctor

Madam, sleeps still.

CORDELIA

O you kind gods,Cure this great breach in his abused nature!The untuned and jarring senses, O, wind upOf this child-changed father!

Doctor

So please your majestyThat we may wake the king: he hath slept long.

CORDELIA

Be govern'd by your knowledge, and proceedI' the sway of your own will. Is he array'd?

Gentleman

Ay, madam; in the heaviness of his sleepWe put fresh garments on him.

Doctor

Be by, good madam, when we do awake him;I doubt not of his temperance.

CORDELIA

Very well.

Doctor

Please you, draw near. Louder the music there!

CORDELIA

O my dear father! Restoration hangThy medicine on my lips; and let this kissRepair those violent harms that my two sistersHave in thy reverence made!

KENT

Kind and dear princess!

CORDELIA

Had you not been their father, these white flakesHad challenged pity of them. Was this a faceTo be opposed against the warring winds?To stand against the deep dread-bolted thunder?In the most terrible and nimble strokeOf quick, cross lightning? to watch--poor perdu!--With this thin helm? Mine enemy's dog,Though he had bit me, should have stood that nightAgainst my fire; and wast thou fain, poor father,To hovel thee with swine, and rogues forlorn,In short and musty straw? Alack, alack!'Tis wonder that thy life and wits at onceHad not concluded all. He wakes; speak to him.

Doctor

Madam, do you; 'tis fittest.

CORDELIA

How does my royal lord? How fares your majesty?

KING LEAR

You do me wrong to take me out o' the grave:Thou art a soul in bliss; but I am boundUpon a wheel of fire, that mine own tearsDo scald like moulten lead.

CORDELIA

Sir, do you know me?

KING LEAR

You are a spirit, I know: when did you die?

CORDELIA

Still, still, far wide!

Doctor

He's scarce awake: let him alone awhile.

KING LEAR

Where have I been? Where am I? Fair daylight?I am mightily abused. I should e'en die with pity,To see another thus. I know not what to say.I will not swear these are my hands: let's see;I feel this pin prick. Would I were assuredOf my condition!

CORDELIA

                  O, look upon me, sir,And hold your hands in benediction o'er me:No, sir, you must not kneel.

KING LEAR

Pray, do not mock me:I am a very foolish fond old man,Fourscore and upward, not an hour more nor less;And, to deal plainly,I fear I am not in my perfect mind.Methinks I should know you, and know this man;Yet I am doubtful for I am mainly ignorantWhat place this is; and all the skill I haveRemembers not these garments; nor I know notWhere I did lodge last night. Do not laugh at me;For, as I am a man, I think this ladyTo be my child Cordelia.

CORDELIA

And so I am, I am.

KING LEAR

Be your tears wet? yes, 'faith. I pray, weep not:If you have poison for me, I will drink it.I know you do not love me; for your sistersHave, as I do remember, done me wrong:You have some cause, they have not.

CORDELIA

No cause, no cause.

KING LEAR

Am I in France?

KENT

                  In your own kingdom, sir.

KING LEAR

Do not abuse me.

Doctor

Be comforted, good madam: the great rage,You see, is kill'd in him: and yet it is dangerTo make him even o'er the time he has lost.Desire him to go in; trouble him no moreTill further settling.

CORDELIA

Will't please your highness walk?

KING LEAR

You must bear with me:Pray you now, forget and forgive: I am old and foolish.Exeunt all but KENT and Gentleman


Gentleman

Holds it true, sir, that the Duke of Cornwall was so slain?

KENT

Most certain, sir.

Gentleman

Who is conductor of his people?

KENT

As 'tis said, the bastard son of Gloucester.

Gentleman

They say Edgar, his banished son, is with the Earlof Kent in Germany.

KENT

Report is changeable. 'Tis time to look about; thepowers of the kingdom approach apace.

Gentleman

The arbitrement is like to be bloody. Fare youwell, sir.Exit


KENT

My point and period will be throughly wrought,Or well or ill, as this day's battle's fought.Exit

ACT V
SCENE I. The British camp, near Dover.

Enter, with drum and colours, EDMUND, REGAN, Gentlemen, and Soldiers.


EDMUND

Know of the duke if his last purpose hold,Or whether since he is advised by aughtTo change the course: he's full of alterationAnd self-reproving: bring his constant pleasure.To a Gentleman, who goes out


REGAN

Our sister's man is certainly miscarried.

EDMUND

'Tis to be doubted, madam.

REGAN

Now, sweet lord,You know the goodness I intend upon you:Tell me--but truly--but then speak the truth,Do you not love my sister?

EDMUND

In honour'd love.

REGAN

But have you never found my brother's wayTo the forfended place?

EDMUND

That thought abuses you.

REGAN

I am doubtful that you have been conjunctAnd bosom'd with her, as far as we call hers.

EDMUND

No, by mine honour, madam.

REGAN

I never shall endure her: dear my lord,Be not familiar with her.

EDMUND

Fear me not:She and the duke her husband!Enter, with drum and colours, ALBANY, GONERIL, and Soldiers


GONERIL

[Aside]  I had rather lose the battle than that sisterShould loosen him and me.

ALBANY

Our very loving sister, well be-met.Sir, this I hear; the king is come to his daughter,With others whom the rigor of our stateForced to cry out. Where I could not be honest,I never yet was valiant: for this business,It toucheth us, as France invades our land,Not bolds the king, with others, whom, I fear,Most just and heavy causes make oppose.

EDMUND

Sir, you speak nobly.

REGAN

Why is this reason'd?

GONERIL

Combine together 'gainst the enemy;For these domestic and particular broilsAre not the question here.

ALBANY

Let's then determineWith the ancient of war on our proceedings.

EDMUND

I shall attend you presently at your tent.

REGAN

Sister, you'll go with us?

GONERIL

No.

REGAN

'Tis most convenient; pray you, go with us.

GONERIL

[Aside]  O, ho, I know the riddle.--I will go.As they are going out, enter EDGAR disguised


EDGAR

If e'er your grace had speech with man so poor,Hear me one word.

ALBANY

                  I'll overtake you. Speak.Exeunt all but ALBANY and EDGAR


EDGAR

Before you fight the battle, ope this letter.If you have victory, let the trumpet soundFor him that brought it: wretched though I seem,I can produce a champion that will proveWhat is avouched there. If you miscarry,Your business of the world hath so an end,And machination ceases. Fortune love you.

ALBANY

Stay till I have read the letter.

EDGAR

I was forbid it.When time shall serve, let but the herald cry,And I'll appear again.

ALBANY

Why, fare thee well: I will o'erlook thy paper.Exit EDGAR
Re-enter EDMUND


EDMUND

The enemy's in view; draw up your powers.Here is the guess of their true strength and forcesBy diligent discovery; but your hasteIs now urged on you.

ALBANY

We will greet the time.Exit


EDMUND

To both these sisters have I sworn my love;Each jealous of the other, as the stungAre of the adder. Which of them shall I take?Both? one? or neither? Neither can be enjoy'd,If both remain alive: to take the widowExasperates, makes mad her sister Goneril;And hardly shall I carry out my side,Her husband being alive. Now then we'll useHis countenance for the battle; which being done,Let her who would be rid of him deviseHis speedy taking off. As for the mercyWhich he intends to Lear and to Cordelia,The battle done, and they within our power,Shall never see his pardon; for my stateStands on me to defend, not to debate.Exit

SCENE II. A field between the two camps.

Alarum within. Enter, with drum and colours,  KING LEAR, CORDELIA, and Soldiers, over the stage; and exeunt


Enter EDGAR and GLOUCESTER


EDGAR

Here, father, take the shadow of this treeFor your good host; pray that the right may thrive:If ever I return to you again,I'll bring you comfort.

GLOUCESTER

Grace go with you, sir!Exit EDGAR
Alarum and retreat within. Re-enter EDGAR


EDGAR

Away, old man; give me thy hand; away!King Lear hath lost, he and his daughter ta'en:Give me thy hand; come on.

GLOUCESTER

No farther, sir; a man may rot even here.

EDGAR

What, in ill thoughts again? Men must endureTheir going hence, even as their coming hither;Ripeness is all: come on.

GLOUCESTER

And that's true too.Exeunt

SCENE III. The British camp near Dover.

Enter, in conquest, with drum and colours, EDMUND,  KING LEAR and CORDELIA, prisoners; Captain, Soldiers,  & c


EDMUND

Some officers take them away: good guard,Until their greater pleasures first be knownThat are to censure them.

CORDELIA

We are not the firstWho, with best meaning, have incurr'd the worst.For thee, oppressed king, am I cast down;Myself could else out-frown false fortune's frown.Shall we not see these daughters and these sisters?

KING LEAR

No, no, no, no! Come, let's away to prison:We two alone will sing like birds i' the cage:When thou dost ask me blessing, I'll kneel down,And ask of thee forgiveness: so we'll live,And pray, and sing, and tell old tales, and laughAt gilded butterflies, and hear poor roguesTalk of court news; and we'll talk with them too,Who loses and who wins; who's in, who's out;And take upon's the mystery of things,As if we were God's spies: and we'll wear out,In a wall'd prison, packs and sects of great ones,That ebb and flow by the moon.

EDMUND

Take them away.

KING LEAR

Upon such sacrifices, my Cordelia,The gods themselves throw incense. Have I caught thee?He that parts us shall bring a brand from heaven,And fire us hence like foxes. Wipe thine eyes;The good-years shall devour them, flesh and fell,Ere they shall make us weep: we'll see 'em starvefirst. Come.Exeunt KING LEAR and CORDELIA, guarded


EDMUND

Come hither, captain; hark.Take thou this note;Giving a paper
go follow them to prison:One step I have advanced thee; if thou dostAs this instructs thee, thou dost make thy wayTo noble fortunes: know thou this, that menAre as the time is: to be tender-mindedDoes not become a sword: thy great employmentWill not bear question; either say thou'lt do 't,Or thrive by other means.

Captain

I'll do 't, my lord.

EDMUND

About it; and write happy when thou hast done.Mark, I say, instantly; and carry it soAs I have set it down.

Captain

I cannot draw a cart, nor eat dried oats;If it be man's work, I'll do 't.Exit
Flourish. Enter ALBANY, GONERIL, REGAN, another Captain, and Soldiers


ALBANY

Sir, you have shown to-day your valiant strain,And fortune led you well: you have the captivesThat were the opposites of this day's strife:We do require them of you, so to use themAs we shall find their merits and our safetyMay equally determine.

EDMUND

Sir, I thought it fitTo send the old and miserable kingTo some retention and appointed guard;Whose age has charms in it, whose title more,To pluck the common bosom on his side,An turn our impress'd lances in our eyesWhich do command them. With him I sent the queen;My reason all the same; and they are readyTo-morrow, or at further space, to appearWhere you shall hold your session. At this timeWe sweat and bleed: the friend hath lost his friend;And the best quarrels, in the heat, are cursedBy those that feel their sharpness:The question of Cordelia and her fatherRequires a fitter place.

ALBANY

Sir, by your patience,I hold you but a subject of this war,Not as a brother.

REGAN

                  That's as we list to grace him.Methinks our pleasure might have been demanded,Ere you had spoke so far. He led our powers;Bore the commission of my place and person;The which immediacy may well stand up,And call itself your brother.

GONERIL

Not so hot:In his own grace he doth exalt himself,More than in your addition.

REGAN

In my rights,By me invested, he compeers the best.

GONERIL

That were the most, if he should husband you.

REGAN

Jesters do oft prove prophets.

GONERIL

Holla, holla!That eye that told you so look'd but a-squint.

REGAN

Lady, I am not well; else I should answerFrom a full-flowing stomach. General,Take thou my soldiers, prisoners, patrimony;Dispose of them, of me; the walls are thine:Witness the world, that I create thee hereMy lord and master.

GONERIL

Mean you to enjoy him?

ALBANY

The let-alone lies not in your good will.

EDMUND

Nor in thine, lord.

ALBANY

Half-blooded fellow, yes.

REGAN

[To EDMUND]  Let the drum strike, and prove my title thine.

ALBANY

Stay yet; hear reason. Edmund, I arrest theeOn capital treason; and, in thine attaint,This gilded serpentPointing to Goneril
For your claim, fair sister,I bar it in the interest of my wife:'Tis she is sub-contracted to this lord,And I, her husband, contradict your bans.If you will marry, make your loves to me,My lady is bespoke.

GONERIL

An interlude!

ALBANY

Thou art arm'd, Gloucester: let the trumpet sound:If none appear to prove upon thy headThy heinous, manifest, and many treasons,There is my pledge;Throwing down a glove
I'll prove it on thy heart,Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing lessThan I have here proclaim'd thee.

REGAN

Sick, O, sick!

GONERIL

[Aside]  If not, I'll ne'er trust medicine.

EDMUND

There's my exchange:Throwing down a glove
what in the world he isThat names me traitor, villain-like he lies:Call by thy trumpet: he that dares approach,On him, on you, who not? I will maintainMy truth and honour firmly.

ALBANY

A herald, ho!

EDMUND

                  A herald, ho, a herald!

ALBANY

Trust to thy single virtue; for thy soldiers,All levied in my name, have in my nameTook their discharge.

REGAN

My sickness grows upon me.

ALBANY

She is not well; convey her to  my tent.Exit Regan, led
Enter a Herald
Come hither, herald,--Let the trumpet sound,And read out this.

Captain

Sound, trumpet!A trumpet sounds


Herald

[Reads]  'If any man of quality or degree withinthe lists of the army will maintain upon Edmund,supposed Earl of Gloucester, that he is a manifoldtraitor, let him appear by the third sound of thetrumpet: he is bold in his defence.'

EDMUND

Sound!First trumpet


Herald

Again!Second trumpet


Herald

Again!Third trumpet
Trumpet answers within
Enter EDGAR, at the third sound, armed, with a trumpet before him


ALBANY

Ask him his purposes, why he appearsUpon this call o' the trumpet.

Herald

What are you?Your name, your quality? and why you answerThis present summons?

EDGAR

Know, my name is lost;By treason's tooth bare-gnawn and canker-bit:Yet am I noble as the adversaryI come to cope.

ALBANY

                  Which is that adversary?

EDGAR

What's he that speaks for Edmund Earl of Gloucester?

EDMUND

Himself: what say'st thou to him?

EDGAR

Draw thy sword,That, if my speech offend a noble heart,Thy arm may do thee justice: here is mine.Behold, it is the privilege of mine honours,My oath, and my profession: I protest,Maugre thy strength, youth, place, and eminence,Despite thy victor sword and fire-new fortune,Thy valour and thy heart, thou art a traitor;False to thy gods, thy brother, and thy father;Conspirant 'gainst this high-illustrious prince;And, from the extremest upward of thy headTo the descent and dust below thy foot,A most toad-spotted traitor. Say thou 'No,'This sword, this arm, and my best spirits, are bentTo prove upon thy heart, whereto I speak,Thou liest.

EDMUND

In wisdom I should ask thy name;But, since thy outside looks so fair and warlike,And that thy tongue some say of breeding breathes,What safe and nicely I might well delayBy rule of knighthood, I disdain and spurn:Back do I toss these treasons to thy head;With the hell-hated lie o'erwhelm thy heart;Which, for they yet glance by and scarcely bruise,This sword of mine shall give them instant way,Where they shall rest for ever. Trumpets, speak!Alarums. They fight. EDMUND falls


ALBANY

Save him, save him!

GONERIL

This is practise, Gloucester:By the law of arms thou wast not bound to answerAn unknown opposite; thou art not vanquish'd,But cozen'd and beguiled.

ALBANY

Shut your mouth, dame,Or with this paper shall I stop it: Hold, sir:Thou worse than any name, read thine own evil:No tearing, lady: I perceive you know it.Gives the letter to EDMUND


GONERIL

Say, if I do, the laws are mine, not thine:Who can arraign me for't.

ALBANY

Most monstrous! oh!Know'st thou this paper?

GONERIL

Ask me not what I know.Exit


ALBANY

Go after her: she's desperate; govern her.

EDMUND

What you have charged me with, that have I done;And more, much more; the time will bring it out:'Tis past, and so am I. But what art thouThat hast this fortune on me? If thou'rt noble,I do forgive thee.

EDGAR

                  Let's exchange charity.I am no less in blood than thou art, Edmund;If more, the more thou hast wrong'd me.My name is Edgar, and thy father's son.The gods are just, and of our pleasant vicesMake instruments to plague us:The dark and vicious place where thee he gotCost him his eyes.

EDMUND

                  Thou hast spoken right, 'tis true;The wheel is come full circle: I am here.

ALBANY

Methought thy very gait did prophesyA royal nobleness: I must embrace thee:Let sorrow split my heart, if ever IDid hate thee or thy father!

EDGAR

Worthy prince, I know't.

ALBANY

Where have you hid yourself?How have you known the miseries of your father?

EDGAR

By nursing them, my lord. List a brief tale;And when 'tis told, O, that my heart would burst!The bloody proclamation to escape,That follow'd me so near,--O, our lives' sweetness!That we the pain of death would hourly dieRather than die at once!--taught me to shiftInto a madman's rags; to assume a semblanceThat very dogs disdain'd: and in this habitMet I my father with his bleeding rings,Their precious stones new lost: became his guide,Led him, begg'd for him, saved him from despair;Never,--O fault!--reveal'd myself unto him,Until some half-hour past, when I was arm'd:Not sure, though hoping, of this good success,I ask'd his blessing, and from first to lastTold him my pilgrimage: but his flaw'd heart,Alack, too weak the conflict to support!'Twixt two extremes of passion, joy and grief,Burst smilingly.

EDMUND

This speech of yours hath moved me,And shall perchance do good: but speak you on;You look as you had something more to say.

ALBANY

If there be more, more woeful, hold it in;For I am almost ready to dissolve,Hearing of this.

EDGAR

                  This would have seem'd a periodTo such as love not sorrow; but another,To amplify too much, would make much more,And top extremity.Whilst I was big in clamour came there in a man,Who, having seen me in my worst estate,Shunn'd my abhorr'd society; but then, findingWho 'twas that so endured, with his strong armsHe fastened on my neck, and bellow'd outAs he'ld burst heaven; threw him on my father;Told the most piteous tale of Lear and himThat ever ear received: which in recountingHis grief grew puissant and the strings of lifeBegan to crack: twice then the trumpets sounded,And there I left him tranced.

ALBANY

But who was this?

EDGAR

Kent, sir, the banish'd Kent; who in disguiseFollow'd his enemy king, and did him serviceImproper for a slave.Enter a Gentleman, with a bloody knife


Gentleman

Help, help, O, help!

EDGAR

What kind of help?

ALBANY

Speak, man.

EDGAR

What means that bloody knife?

Gentleman

'Tis hot, it smokes;It came even from the heart of--O, she's dead!

ALBANY

Who dead? speak, man.

Gentleman

Your lady, sir, your lady: and her sisterBy her is poisoned; she hath confess'd it.

EDMUND

I was contracted to them both: all threeNow marry in an instant.

EDGAR

Here comes Kent.

ALBANY

Produce their bodies, be they alive or dead:This judgment of the heavens, that makes us tremble,Touches us not with pity.Exit Gentleman
Enter KENT
O, is this he?The time will not allow the complimentWhich very manners urges.

KENT

I am comeTo bid my king and master aye good night:Is he not here?

ALBANY

                  Great thing of us forgot!Speak, Edmund, where's the king? and where's Cordelia?See'st thou this object, Kent?The bodies of GONERIL and REGAN are brought in


KENT

Alack, why thus?

EDMUND

                  Yet Edmund was beloved:The one the other poison'd for my sake,And after slew herself.

ALBANY

Even so. Cover their faces.

EDMUND

I pant for life: some good I mean to do,Despite of mine own nature. Quickly send,Be brief in it, to the castle; for my writIs on the life of Lear and on Cordelia:Nay, send in time.

ALBANY

                  Run, run, O, run!

EDGAR

To who, my lord? Who hath the office? sendThy token of reprieve.

EDMUND

Well thought on: take my sword,Give it the captain.

ALBANY

Haste thee, for thy life.Exit EDGAR


EDMUND

He hath commission from thy wife and meTo hang Cordelia in the prison, andTo lay the blame upon her own despair,That she fordid herself.

ALBANY

The gods defend her! Bear him hence awhile.EDMUND is borne off
Re-enter KING LEAR, with CORDELIA dead in his arms; EDGAR, Captain, and others following


KING LEAR

Howl, howl, howl, howl! O, you are men of stones:Had I your tongues and eyes, I'ld use them soThat heaven's vault should crack. She's gone for ever!I know when one is dead, and when one lives;She's dead as earth. Lend me a looking-glass;If that her breath will mist or stain the stone,Why, then she lives.

KENT

Is this the promised end

EDGAR

Or image of that horror?

ALBANY

Fall, and cease!

KING LEAR

This feather stirs; she lives! if it be so,It is a chance which does redeem all sorrowsThat ever I have felt.

KENT

[Kneeling]  O my good master!

KING LEAR

Prithee, away.

EDGAR

'Tis noble Kent, your friend.

KING LEAR

A plague upon you, murderers, traitors all!I might have saved her; now she's gone for ever!Cordelia, Cordelia! stay a little. Ha!What is't thou say'st? Her voice was ever soft,Gentle, and low, an excellent thing in woman.I kill'd the slave that was a-hanging thee.

Captain

'Tis true, my lords, he did.

KING LEAR

Did I not, fellow?I have seen the day, with my good biting falchionI would have made them skip: I am old now,And these same crosses spoil me. Who are you?Mine eyes are not o' the best: I'll tell you straight.

KENT

If fortune brag of two she loved and hated,One of them we behold.

KING LEAR

This is a dull sight. Are you not Kent?

KENT

The same,Your servant Kent: Where is your servant Caius?

KING LEAR

He's a good fellow, I can tell you that;He'll strike, and quickly too: he's dead and rotten.

KENT

No, my good lord; I am the very man,--

KING LEAR

I'll see that straight.

KENT

That, from your first of difference and decay,Have follow'd your sad steps.

KING LEAR

You are welcome hither.

KENT

Nor no man else: all's cheerless, dark, and deadly.Your eldest daughters have fordone them selves,And desperately are dead.

KING LEAR

Ay, so I think.

ALBANY

He knows not what he says: and vain it isThat we present us to him.

EDGAR

Very bootless.Enter a Captain


Captain

Edmund is dead, my lord.

ALBANY

That's but a trifle here.You lords and noble friends, know our intent.What comfort to this great decay may comeShall be applied: for us we will resign,During the life of this old majesty,To him our absolute power:To EDGAR and KENT
you, to your rights:With boot, and such addition as your honoursHave more than merited. All friends shall tasteThe wages of their virtue, and all foesThe cup of their deservings. O, see, see!

KING LEAR

And my poor fool is hang'd! No, no, no life!Why should a dog, a horse, a rat, have life,And thou no breath at all? Thou'lt come no more,Never, never, never, never, never!Pray you, undo this button: thank you, sir.Do you see this? Look on her, look, her lips,Look there, look there!Dies


EDGAR

He faints! My lord, my lord!

KENT

Break, heart; I prithee, break!

EDGAR

Look up, my lord.

KENT

Vex not his ghost: O, let him pass! he hates him muchThat would upon the rack of this tough worldStretch him out longer.

EDGAR

He is gone, indeed.

KENT

The wonder is, he hath endured so long:He but usurp'd his life.

ALBANY

Bear them from hence. Our present businessIs general woe.To KENT and EDGAR
Friends of my soul, you twainRule in this realm, and the gored state sustain.

KENT

I have a journey, sir, shortly to go;My master calls me, I must not say no.

ALBANY

The weight of this sad time we must obey;Speak what we feel, not what we ought to say.The oldest hath borne most: we that are youngShall never see so much, nor live so long.Exeunt, with a dead march
