ACT I
SCENE I. DUKE ORSINO's palace.

Enter DUKE ORSINO, CURIO, and other Lords; Musicians attending


DUKE ORSINO

If music be the food of love, play on;Give me excess of it, that, surfeiting,The appetite may sicken, and so die.That strain again! it had a dying fall:O, it came o'er my ear like the sweet sound,That breathes upon a bank of violets,Stealing and giving odour! Enough; no more:'Tis not so sweet now as it was before.O spirit of love! how quick and fresh art thou,That, notwithstanding thy capacityReceiveth as the sea, nought enters there,Of what validity and pitch soe'er,But falls into abatement and low price,Even in a minute: so full of shapes is fancyThat it alone is high fantastical.

CURIO

Will you go hunt, my lord?

DUKE ORSINO

What, Curio?

CURIO

The hart.

DUKE ORSINO

        Why, so I do, the noblest that I have:O, when mine eyes did see Olivia first,Methought she purged the air of pestilence!That instant was I turn'd into a hart;And my desires, like fell and cruel hounds,E'er since pursue me.Enter VALENTINE
How now! what news from her?

VALENTINE

So please my lord, I might not be admitted;But from her handmaid do return this answer:The element itself, till seven years' heat,Shall not behold her face at ample view;But, like a cloistress, she will veiled walkAnd water once a day her chamber roundWith eye-offending brine: all this to seasonA brother's dead love, which she would keep freshAnd lasting in her sad remembrance.

DUKE ORSINO

O, she that hath a heart of that fine frameTo pay this debt of love but to a brother,How will she love, when the rich golden shaftHath kill'd the flock of all affections elseThat live in her; when liver, brain and heart,These sovereign thrones, are all supplied, and fill'dHer sweet perfections with one self king!Away before me to sweet beds of flowers:Love-thoughts lie rich when canopied with bowers.Exeunt

SCENE II. The sea-coast.

Enter VIOLA, a Captain, and Sailors


VIOLA

What country, friends, is this?

Captain

This is Illyria, lady.

VIOLA

And what should I do in Illyria?My brother he is in Elysium.Perchance he is not drown'd: what think you, sailors?

Captain

It is perchance that you yourself were saved.

VIOLA

O my poor brother! and so perchance may he be.

Captain

True, madam: and, to comfort you with chance,Assure yourself, after our ship did split,When you and those poor number saved with youHung on our driving boat, I saw your brother,Most provident in peril, bind himself,Courage and hope both teaching him the practise,To a strong mast that lived upon the sea;Where, like Arion on the dolphin's back,I saw him hold acquaintance with the wavesSo long as I could see.

VIOLA

For saying so, there's gold:Mine own escape unfoldeth to my hope,Whereto thy speech serves for authority,The like of him. Know'st thou this country?

Captain

Ay, madam, well; for I was bred and bornNot three hours' travel from this very place.

VIOLA

Who governs here?

Captain

A noble duke, in nature as in name.

VIOLA

What is the name?

Captain

Orsino.

VIOLA

Orsino! I have heard my father name him:He was a bachelor then.

Captain

And so is now, or was so very late;For but a month ago I went from hence,And then 'twas fresh in murmur,--as, you know,What great ones do the less will prattle of,--That he did seek the love of fair Olivia.

VIOLA

What's she?

Captain

A virtuous maid, the daughter of a countThat died some twelvemonth since, then leaving herIn the protection of his son, her brother,Who shortly also died: for whose dear love,They say, she hath abjured the companyAnd sight of men.

VIOLA

                  O that I served that ladyAnd might not be delivered to the world,Till I had made mine own occasion mellow,What my estate is!

Captain

That were hard to compass;Because she will admit no kind of suit,No, not the duke's.

VIOLA

There is a fair behavior in thee, captain;And though that nature with a beauteous wallDoth oft close in pollution, yet of theeI will believe thou hast a mind that suitsWith this thy fair and outward character.I prithee, and I'll pay thee bounteously,Conceal me what I am, and be my aidFor such disguise as haply shall becomeThe form of my intent. I'll serve this duke:Thou shall present me as an eunuch to him:It may be worth thy pains; for I can singAnd speak to him in many sorts of musicThat will allow me very worth his service.What else may hap to time I will commit;Only shape thou thy silence to my wit.

Captain

Be you his eunuch, and your mute I'll be:When my tongue blabs, then let mine eyes not see.

VIOLA

I thank thee: lead me on.Exeunt

SCENE III. OLIVIA'S house.

Enter SIR TOBY BELCH and MARIA


SIR TOBY BELCH

What a plague means my niece, to take the death ofher brother thus? I am sure care's an enemy to life.

MARIA

By my troth, Sir Toby, you must come in earlier o'nights: your cousin, my lady, takes greatexceptions to your ill hours.

SIR TOBY BELCH

Why, let her except, before excepted.

MARIA

Ay, but you must confine yourself within the modestlimits of order.

SIR TOBY BELCH

Confine! I'll confine myself no finer than I am:these clothes are good enough to drink in; and so bethese boots too: an they be not, let them hangthemselves in their own straps.

MARIA

That quaffing and drinking will undo you: I heardmy lady talk of it yesterday; and of a foolishknight that you brought in one night here to be her wooer.

SIR TOBY BELCH

Who, Sir Andrew Aguecheek?

MARIA

Ay, he.

SIR TOBY BELCH

He's as tall a man as any's in Illyria.

MARIA

What's that to the purpose?

SIR TOBY BELCH

Why, he has three thousand ducats a year.

MARIA

Ay, but he'll have but a year in all these ducats:he's a very fool and a prodigal.

SIR TOBY BELCH

Fie, that you'll say so! he plays o' theviol-de-gamboys, and speaks three or four languagesword for word without book, and hath all the goodgifts of nature.

MARIA

He hath indeed, almost natural: for besides thathe's a fool, he's a great quarreller: and but thathe hath the gift of a coward to allay the gust hehath in quarrelling, 'tis thought among the prudenthe would quickly have the gift of a grave.

SIR TOBY BELCH

By this hand, they are scoundrels and subtractorsthat say so of him. Who are they?

MARIA

They that add, moreover, he's drunk nightly in your company.

SIR TOBY BELCH

With drinking healths to my niece: I'll drink toher as long as there is a passage in my throat anddrink in Illyria: he's a coward and a coystrillthat will not drink to my niece till his brains turno' the toe like a parish-top. What, wench!Castiliano vulgo! for here comes Sir Andrew Agueface.Enter SIR ANDREW


SIR ANDREW

Sir Toby Belch! how now, Sir Toby Belch!

SIR TOBY BELCH

Sweet Sir Andrew!

SIR ANDREW

Bless you, fair shrew.

MARIA

And you too, sir.

SIR TOBY BELCH

Accost, Sir Andrew, accost.

SIR ANDREW

What's that?

SIR TOBY BELCH

My niece's chambermaid.

SIR ANDREW

Good Mistress Accost, I desire better acquaintance.

MARIA

My name is Mary, sir.

SIR ANDREW

Good Mistress Mary Accost,--

SIR TOBY BELCH

You mistake, knight; 'accost' is front her, boardher, woo her, assail her.

SIR ANDREW

By my troth, I would not undertake her in thiscompany. Is that the meaning of 'accost'?

MARIA

Fare you well, gentlemen.

SIR TOBY BELCH

An thou let part so, Sir Andrew, would thou mightstnever draw sword again.

SIR ANDREW

An you part so, mistress, I would I might neverdraw sword again. Fair lady, do you think you havefools in hand?

MARIA

Sir, I have not you by the hand.

SIR ANDREW

Marry, but you shall have; and here's my hand.

MARIA

Now, sir, 'thought is free:' I pray you, bringyour hand to the buttery-bar and let it drink.

SIR ANDREW

Wherefore, sweet-heart? what's your metaphor?

MARIA

It's dry, sir.

SIR ANDREW

Why, I think so: I am not such an ass but I cankeep my hand dry. But what's your jest?

MARIA

A dry jest, sir.

SIR ANDREW

Are you full of them?

MARIA

Ay, sir, I have them at my fingers' ends: marry,now I let go your hand, I am barren.Exit


SIR TOBY BELCH

O knight thou lackest a cup of canary: when did Isee thee so put down?

SIR ANDREW

Never in your life, I think; unless you see canaryput me down. Methinks sometimes I have no more witthan a Christian or an ordinary man has: but I am agreat eater of beef and I believe that does harm to my wit.

SIR TOBY BELCH

No question.

SIR ANDREW

An I thought that, I'ld forswear it. I'll ride hometo-morrow, Sir Toby.

SIR TOBY BELCH

Pourquoi, my dear knight?

SIR ANDREW

What is 'Pourquoi'? do or not do? I would I hadbestowed that time in the tongues that I have infencing, dancing and bear-baiting: O, had I butfollowed the arts!

SIR TOBY BELCH

Then hadst thou had an excellent head of hair.

SIR ANDREW

Why, would that have mended my hair?

SIR TOBY BELCH

Past question; for thou seest it will not curl by nature.

SIR ANDREW

But it becomes me well enough, does't not?

SIR TOBY BELCH

Excellent; it hangs like flax on a distaff; and Ihope to see a housewife take thee between her legsand spin it off.

SIR ANDREW

Faith, I'll home to-morrow, Sir Toby: your niecewill not be seen; or if she be, it's four to oneshe'll none of me: the count himself here hard by woos her.

SIR TOBY BELCH

She'll none o' the count: she'll not match aboveher degree, neither in estate, years, nor wit; Ihave heard her swear't. Tut, there's life in't,man.

SIR ANDREW

I'll stay a month longer. I am a fellow o' thestrangest mind i' the world; I delight in masquesand revels sometimes altogether.

SIR TOBY BELCH

Art thou good at these kickshawses, knight?

SIR ANDREW

As any man in Illyria, whatsoever he be, under thedegree of my betters; and yet I will not comparewith an old man.

SIR TOBY BELCH

What is thy excellence in a galliard, knight?

SIR ANDREW

Faith, I can cut a caper.

SIR TOBY BELCH

And I can cut the mutton to't.

SIR ANDREW

And I think I have the back-trick simply as strongas any man in Illyria.

SIR TOBY BELCH

Wherefore are these things hid? wherefore havethese gifts a curtain before 'em? are they like totake dust, like Mistress Mall's picture? why dostthou not go to church in a galliard and come home ina coranto? My very walk should be a jig; I would notso much as make water but in a sink-a-pace. Whatdost thou mean? Is it a world to hide virtues in?I did think, by the excellent constitution of thyleg, it was formed under the star of a galliard.

SIR ANDREW

Ay, 'tis strong, and it does indifferent well in aflame-coloured stock. Shall we set about some revels?

SIR TOBY BELCH

What shall we do else? were we not born under Taurus?

SIR ANDREW

Taurus! That's sides and heart.

SIR TOBY BELCH

No, sir; it is legs and thighs. Let me see thecaper; ha! higher: ha, ha! excellent!Exeunt

SCENE IV. DUKE ORSINO's palace.

Enter VALENTINE and VIOLA in man's attire


VALENTINE

If the duke continue these favours towards you,Cesario, you are like to be much advanced: he hathknown you but three days, and already you are no stranger.

VIOLA

You either fear his humour or my negligence, thatyou call in question the continuance of his love:is he inconstant, sir, in his favours?

VALENTINE

No, believe me.

VIOLA

I thank you. Here comes the count.Enter DUKE ORSINO, CURIO, and Attendants


DUKE ORSINO

Who saw Cesario, ho?

VIOLA

On your attendance, my lord; here.

DUKE ORSINO

Stand you a while aloof, Cesario,Thou know'st no less but all; I have unclasp'dTo thee the book even of my secret soul:Therefore, good youth, address thy gait unto her;Be not denied access, stand at her doors,And tell them, there thy fixed foot shall growTill thou have audience.

VIOLA

Sure, my noble lord,If she be so abandon'd to her sorrowAs it is spoke, she never will admit me.

DUKE ORSINO

Be clamorous and leap all civil boundsRather than make unprofited return.

VIOLA

Say I do speak with her, my lord, what then?

DUKE ORSINO

O, then unfold the passion of my love,Surprise her with discourse of my dear faith:It shall become thee well to act my woes;She will attend it better in thy youthThan in a nuncio's of more grave aspect.

VIOLA

I think not so, my lord.

DUKE ORSINO

Dear lad, believe it;For they shall yet belie thy happy years,That say thou art a man: Diana's lipIs not more smooth and rubious; thy small pipeIs as the maiden's organ, shrill and sound,And all is semblative a woman's part.I know thy constellation is right aptFor this affair. Some four or five attend him;All, if you will; for I myself am bestWhen least in company. Prosper well in this,And thou shalt live as freely as thy lord,To call his fortunes thine.

VIOLA

I'll do my bestTo woo your lady:Aside
yet, a barful strife!Whoe'er I woo, myself would be his wife.Exeunt

SCENE V. OLIVIA'S house.

Enter MARIA and Clown


MARIA

Nay, either tell me where thou hast been, or I willnot open my lips so wide as a bristle may enter inway of thy excuse: my lady will hang thee for thy absence.

Clown

Let her hang me: he that is well hanged in thisworld needs to fear no colours.

MARIA

Make that good.

Clown

He shall see none to fear.

MARIA

A good lenten answer: I can tell thee where thatsaying was born, of 'I fear no colours.'

Clown

Where, good Mistress Mary?

MARIA

In the wars; and that may you be bold to say in your foolery.

Clown

Well, God give them wisdom that have it; and thosethat are fools, let them use their talents.

MARIA

Yet you will be hanged for being so long absent; or,to be turned away, is not that as good as a hanging to you?

Clown

Many a good hanging prevents a bad marriage; and,for turning away, let summer bear it out.

MARIA

You are resolute, then?

Clown

Not so, neither; but I am resolved on two points.

MARIA

That if one break, the other will hold; or, if bothbreak, your gaskins fall.

Clown

Apt, in good faith; very apt. Well, go thy way; ifSir Toby would leave drinking, thou wert as witty apiece of Eve's flesh as any in Illyria.

MARIA

Peace, you rogue, no more o' that. Here comes mylady: make your excuse wisely, you were best.Exit


Clown

Wit, an't be thy will, put me into good fooling!Those wits, that think they have thee, do very oftprove fools; and I, that am sure I lack thee, maypass for a wise man: for what says Quinapalus?'Better a witty fool, than a foolish wit.'Enter OLIVIA with MALVOLIO
God bless thee, lady!

OLIVIA

Take the fool away.

Clown

Do you not hear, fellows? Take away the lady.

OLIVIA

Go to, you're a dry fool; I'll no more of you:besides, you grow dishonest.

Clown

Two faults, madonna, that drink and good counselwill amend: for give the dry fool drink, then isthe fool not dry: bid the dishonest man mendhimself; if he mend, he is no longer dishonest; ifhe cannot, let the botcher mend him. Any thingthat's mended is but patched: virtue thattransgresses is but patched with sin; and sin thatamends is but patched with virtue. If that thissimple syllogism will serve, so; if it will not,what remedy? As there is no true cuckold butcalamity, so beauty's a flower. The lady bade takeaway the fool; therefore, I say again, take her away.

OLIVIA

Sir, I bade them take away you.

Clown

Misprision in the highest degree! Lady, cucullus nonfacit monachum; that's as much to say as I wear notmotley in my brain. Good madonna, give me leave toprove you a fool.

OLIVIA

Can you do it?

Clown

Dexterously, good madonna.

OLIVIA

Make your proof.

Clown

I must catechise you for it, madonna: good my mouseof virtue, answer me.

OLIVIA

Well, sir, for want of other idleness, I'll bide your proof.

Clown

Good madonna, why mournest thou?

OLIVIA

Good fool, for my brother's death.

Clown

I think his soul is in hell, madonna.

OLIVIA

I know his soul is in heaven, fool.

Clown

The more fool, madonna, to mourn for your brother'ssoul being in heaven. Take away the fool, gentlemen.

OLIVIA

What think you of this fool, Malvolio? doth he not mend?

MALVOLIO

Yes, and shall do till the pangs of death shake him:infirmity, that decays the wise, doth ever make thebetter fool.

Clown

God send you, sir, a speedy infirmity, for thebetter increasing your folly! Sir Toby will besworn that I am no fox; but he will not pass hisword for two pence that you are no fool.

OLIVIA

How say you to that, Malvolio?

MALVOLIO

I marvel your ladyship takes delight in such abarren rascal: I saw him put down the other daywith an ordinary fool that has no more brainthan a stone. Look you now, he's out of his guardalready; unless you laugh and minister occasion tohim, he is gagged. I protest, I take these wise men,that crow so at these set kind of fools, no betterthan the fools' zanies.

OLIVIA

Oh, you are sick of self-love, Malvolio, and tastewith a distempered appetite. To be generous,guiltless and of free disposition, is to take thosethings for bird-bolts that you deem cannon-bullets:there is no slander in an allowed fool, though he donothing but rail; nor no railing in a known discreetman, though he do nothing but reprove.

Clown

Now Mercury endue thee with leasing, for thouspeakest well of fools!Re-enter MARIA


MARIA

Madam, there is at the gate a young gentleman muchdesires to speak with you.

OLIVIA

From the Count Orsino, is it?

MARIA

I know not, madam: 'tis a fair young man, and well attended.

OLIVIA

Who of my people hold him in delay?

MARIA

Sir Toby, madam, your kinsman.

OLIVIA

Fetch him off, I pray you; he speaks nothing butmadman: fie on him!Exit MARIA
Go you, Malvolio: if it be a suit from the count, Iam sick, or not at home; what you will, to dismiss it.Exit MALVOLIO
Now you see, sir, how your fooling grows old, andpeople dislike it.

Clown

Thou hast spoke for us, madonna, as if thy eldestson should be a fool; whose skull Jove cram withbrains! for,--here he comes,--one of thy kin has amost weak pia mater.Enter SIR TOBY BELCH


OLIVIA

By mine honour, half drunk. What is he at the gate, cousin?

SIR TOBY BELCH

A gentleman.

OLIVIA

A gentleman! what gentleman?

SIR TOBY BELCH

'Tis a gentle man here--a plague o' thesepickle-herring! How now, sot!

Clown

Good Sir Toby!

OLIVIA

Cousin, cousin, how have you come so early by this lethargy?

SIR TOBY BELCH

Lechery! I defy lechery. There's one at the gate.

OLIVIA

Ay, marry, what is he?

SIR TOBY BELCH

Let him be the devil, an he will, I care not: giveme faith, say I. Well, it's all one.Exit


OLIVIA

What's a drunken man like, fool?

Clown

Like a drowned man, a fool and a mad man: onedraught above heat makes him a fool; the second madshim; and a third drowns him.

OLIVIA

Go thou and seek the crowner, and let him sit o' mycoz; for he's in the third degree of drink, he'sdrowned: go, look after him.

Clown

He is but mad yet, madonna; and the fool shall lookto the madman.Exit
Re-enter MALVOLIO


MALVOLIO

Madam, yond young fellow swears he will speak withyou. I told him you were sick; he takes on him tounderstand so much, and therefore comes to speakwith you. I told him you were asleep; he seems tohave a foreknowledge of that too, and thereforecomes to speak with you. What is to be said to him,lady? he's fortified against any denial.

OLIVIA

Tell him he shall not speak with me.

MALVOLIO

Has been told so; and he says, he'll stand at yourdoor like a sheriff's post, and be the supporter toa bench, but he'll speak with you.

OLIVIA

What kind o' man is he?

MALVOLIO

Why, of mankind.

OLIVIA

What manner of man?

MALVOLIO

Of very ill manner; he'll speak with you, will you or no.

OLIVIA

Of what personage and years is he?

MALVOLIO

Not yet old enough for a man, nor young enough fora boy; as a squash is before 'tis a peascod, or acooling when 'tis almost an apple: 'tis with himin standing water, between boy and man. He is verywell-favoured and he speaks very shrewishly; onewould think his mother's milk were scarce out of him.

OLIVIA

Let him approach: call in my gentlewoman.

MALVOLIO

Gentlewoman, my lady calls.Exit
Re-enter MARIA


OLIVIA

Give me my veil: come, throw it o'er my face.We'll once more hear Orsino's embassy.Enter VIOLA, and Attendants


VIOLA

The honourable lady of the house, which is she?

OLIVIA

Speak to me; I shall answer for her.Your will?

VIOLA

Most radiant, exquisite and unmatchable beauty,--Ipray you, tell me if this be the lady of the house,for I never saw her: I would be loath to cast awaymy speech, for besides that it is excellently wellpenned, I have taken great pains to con it. Goodbeauties, let me sustain no scorn; I am verycomptible, even to the least sinister usage.

OLIVIA

Whence came you, sir?

VIOLA

I can say little more than I have studied, and thatquestion's out of my part. Good gentle one, give memodest assurance if you be the lady of the house,that I may proceed in my speech.

OLIVIA

Are you a comedian?

VIOLA

No, my profound heart: and yet, by the very fangsof malice I swear, I am not that I play. Are youthe lady of the house?

OLIVIA

If I do not usurp myself, I am.

VIOLA

Most certain, if you are she, you do usurpyourself; for what is yours to bestow is not yoursto reserve. But this is from my commission: I willon with my speech in your praise, and then show youthe heart of my message.

OLIVIA

Come to what is important in't: I forgive you the praise.

VIOLA

Alas, I took great pains to study it, and 'tis poetical.

OLIVIA

It is the more like to be feigned: I pray you,keep it in. I heard you were saucy at my gates,and allowed your approach rather to wonder at youthan to hear you. If you be not mad, be gone; ifyou have reason, be brief: 'tis not that time ofmoon with me to make one in so skipping a dialogue.

MARIA

Will you hoist sail, sir? here lies your way.

VIOLA

No, good swabber; I am to hull here a littlelonger. Some mollification for your giant, sweetlady. Tell me your mind: I am a messenger.

OLIVIA

Sure, you have some hideous matter to deliver, whenthe courtesy of it is so fearful. Speak your office.

VIOLA

It alone concerns your ear. I bring no overture ofwar, no taxation of homage: I hold the olive in myhand; my words are as fun of peace as matter.

OLIVIA

Yet you began rudely. What are you? what would you?

VIOLA

The rudeness that hath appeared in me have Ilearned from my entertainment. What I am, and what Iwould, are as secret as maidenhead; to your ears,divinity, to any other's, profanation.

OLIVIA

Give us the place alone: we will hear this divinity.Exeunt MARIA and Attendants
Now, sir, what is your text?

VIOLA

Most sweet lady,--

OLIVIA

A comfortable doctrine, and much may be said of it.Where lies your text?

VIOLA

In Orsino's bosom.

OLIVIA

In his bosom! In what chapter of his bosom?

VIOLA

To answer by the method, in the first of his heart.

OLIVIA

O, I have read it: it is heresy. Have you no more to say?

VIOLA

Good madam, let me see your face.

OLIVIA

Have you any commission from your lord to negotiatewith my face? You are now out of your text: butwe will draw the curtain and show you the picture.Look you, sir, such a one I was this present: is'tnot well done?Unveiling


VIOLA

Excellently done, if God did all.

OLIVIA

'Tis in grain, sir; 'twill endure wind and weather.

VIOLA

'Tis beauty truly blent, whose red and whiteNature's own sweet and cunning hand laid on:Lady, you are the cruell'st she alive,If you will lead these graces to the graveAnd leave the world no copy.

OLIVIA

O, sir, I will not be so hard-hearted; I will giveout divers schedules of my beauty: it shall beinventoried, and every particle and utensillabelled to my will: as, item, two lips,indifferent red; item, two grey eyes, with lids tothem; item, one neck, one chin, and so forth. Wereyou sent hither to praise me?

VIOLA

I see you what you are, you are too proud;But, if you were the devil, you are fair.My lord and master loves you: O, such loveCould be but recompensed, though you were crown'dThe nonpareil of beauty!

OLIVIA

How does he love me?

VIOLA

With adorations, fertile tears,With groans that thunder love, with sighs of fire.

OLIVIA

Your lord does know my mind; I cannot love him:Yet I suppose him virtuous, know him noble,Of great estate, of fresh and stainless youth;In voices well divulged, free, learn'd and valiant;And in dimension and the shape of natureA gracious person: but yet I cannot love him;He might have took his answer long ago.

VIOLA

If I did love you in my master's flame,With such a suffering, such a deadly life,In your denial I would find no sense;I would not understand it.

OLIVIA

Why, what would you?

VIOLA

Make me a willow cabin at your gate,And call upon my soul within the house;Write loyal cantons of contemned loveAnd sing them loud even in the dead of night;Halloo your name to the reverberate hillsAnd make the babbling gossip of the airCry out 'Olivia!' O, You should not restBetween the elements of air and earth,But you should pity me!

OLIVIA

You might do much.What is your parentage?

VIOLA

Above my fortunes, yet my state is well:I am a gentleman.

OLIVIA

                  Get you to your lord;I cannot love him: let him send no more;Unless, perchance, you come to me again,To tell me how he takes it. Fare you well:I thank you for your pains: spend this for me.

VIOLA

I am no fee'd post, lady; keep your purse:My master, not myself, lacks recompense.Love make his heart of flint that you shall love;And let your fervor, like my master's, bePlaced in contempt! Farewell, fair cruelty.Exit


OLIVIA

'What is your parentage?''Above my fortunes, yet my state is well:I am a gentleman.' I'll be sworn thou art;Thy tongue, thy face, thy limbs, actions and spirit,Do give thee five-fold blazon: not too fast:soft, soft!Unless the master were the man. How now!Even so quickly may one catch the plague?Methinks I feel this youth's perfectionsWith an invisible and subtle stealthTo creep in at mine eyes. Well, let it be.What ho, Malvolio!Re-enter MALVOLIO


MALVOLIO

                  Here, madam, at your service.

OLIVIA

Run after that same peevish messenger,The county's man: he left this ring behind him,Would I or not: tell him I'll none of it.Desire him not to flatter with his lord,Nor hold him up with hopes; I am not for him:If that the youth will come this way to-morrow,I'll give him reasons for't: hie thee, Malvolio.

MALVOLIO

Madam, I will.Exit


OLIVIA

I do I know not what, and fear to findMine eye too great a flatterer for my mind.Fate, show thy force: ourselves we do not owe;What is decreed must be, and be this so.Exit

ACT II
SCENE I. The sea-coast.

Enter ANTONIO and SEBASTIAN


ANTONIO

Will you stay no longer? nor will you not that I go with you?

SEBASTIAN

By your patience, no. My stars shine darkly overme: the malignancy of my fate might perhapsdistemper yours; therefore I shall crave of you yourleave that I may bear my evils alone: it were a badrecompense for your love, to lay any of them on you.ANTONIO: Let me yet know of you whither you are bound.

SEBASTIAN

No, sooth, sir: my determinate voyage is mereextravagancy. But I perceive in you so excellent atouch of modesty, that you will not extort from mewhat I am willing to keep in; therefore it chargesme in manners the rather to express myself. Youmust know of me then, Antonio, my name is Sebastian,which I called Roderigo. My father was thatSebastian of Messaline, whom I know you have heardof. He left behind him myself and a sister, bothborn in an hour: if the heavens had been pleased,would we had so ended! but you, sir, altered that;for some hour before you took me from the breach ofthe sea was my sister drowned.

ANTONIO

Alas the day!

SEBASTIAN

A lady, sir, though it was said she much resembledme, was yet of many accounted beautiful: but,though I could not with such estimable wonderoverfar believe that, yet thus far I will boldlypublish her; she bore a mind that envy could not butcall fair. She is drowned already, sir, with saltwater, though I seem to drown her remembrance again with more.

ANTONIO

Pardon me, sir, your bad entertainment.

SEBASTIAN

O good Antonio, forgive me your trouble.

ANTONIO

If you will not murder me for my love, let me beyour servant.

SEBASTIAN

If you will not undo what you have done, that is,kill him whom you have recovered, desire it not.Fare ye well at once: my bosom is full of kindness,and I am yet so near the manners of my mother, thatupon the least occasion more mine eyes will telltales of me. I am bound to the Count Orsino's court: farewell.Exit


ANTONIO

The gentleness of all the gods go with thee!I have many enemies in Orsino's court,Else would I very shortly see thee there.But, come what may, I do adore thee so,That danger shall seem sport, and I will go.Exit

SCENE II. A street.

Enter VIOLA, MALVOLIO following


MALVOLIO

Were not you even now with the Countess Olivia?

VIOLA

Even now, sir; on a moderate pace I have sincearrived but hither.

MALVOLIO

She returns this ring to you, sir: you might havesaved me my pains, to have taken it away yourself.She adds, moreover, that you should put your lordinto a desperate assurance she will none of him:and one thing more, that you be never so hardy tocome again in his affairs, unless it be to reportyour lord's taking of this. Receive it so.

VIOLA

She took the ring of me: I'll none of it.

MALVOLIO

Come, sir, you peevishly threw it to her; and herwill is, it should be so returned: if it be worthstooping for, there it lies in your eye; if not, beit his that finds it.Exit


VIOLA

I left no ring with her: what means this lady?Fortune forbid my outside have not charm'd her!She made good view of me; indeed, so much,That sure methought her eyes had lost her tongue,For she did speak in starts distractedly.She loves me, sure; the cunning of her passionInvites me in this churlish messenger.None of my lord's ring! why, he sent her none.I am the man: if it be so, as 'tis,Poor lady, she were better love a dream.Disguise, I see, thou art a wickedness,Wherein the pregnant enemy does much.How easy is it for the proper-falseIn women's waxen hearts to set their forms!Alas, our frailty is the cause, not we!For such as we are made of, such we be.How will this fadge? my master loves her dearly;And I, poor monster, fond as much on him;And she, mistaken, seems to dote on me.What will become of this? As I am man,My state is desperate for my master's love;As I am woman,--now alas the day!--What thriftless sighs shall poor Olivia breathe!O time! thou must untangle this, not I;It is too hard a knot for me to untie!Exit

SCENE III. OLIVIA's house.

Enter SIR TOBY BELCH and SIR ANDREW


SIR TOBY BELCH

Approach, Sir Andrew: not to be abed aftermidnight is to be up betimes; and 'diluculosurgere,' thou know'st,--

SIR ANDREW

Nay, my troth, I know not: but I know, to be uplate is to be up late.

SIR TOBY BELCH

A false conclusion: I hate it as an unfilled can.To be up after midnight and to go to bed then, isearly: so that to go to bed after midnight is to goto bed betimes. Does not our life consist of thefour elements?

SIR ANDREW

Faith, so they say; but I think it rather consistsof eating and drinking.

SIR TOBY BELCH

Thou'rt a scholar; let us therefore eat and drink.Marian, I say! a stoup of wine!Enter Clown


SIR ANDREW

Here comes the fool, i' faith.

Clown

How now, my hearts! did you never see the pictureof 'we three'?

SIR TOBY BELCH

Welcome, ass. Now let's have a catch.

SIR ANDREW

By my troth, the fool has an excellent breast. Ihad rather than forty shillings I had such a leg,and so sweet a breath to sing, as the fool has. Insooth, thou wast in very gracious fooling lastnight, when thou spokest of Pigrogromitus, of theVapians passing the equinoctial of Queubus: 'twasvery good, i' faith. I sent thee sixpence for thyleman: hadst it?

Clown

I did impeticos thy gratillity; for Malvolio's noseis no whipstock: my lady has a white hand, and theMyrmidons are no bottle-ale houses.

SIR ANDREW

Excellent! why, this is the best fooling, when allis done. Now, a song.

SIR TOBY BELCH

Come on; there is sixpence for you: let's have a song.

SIR ANDREW

There's a testril of me too: if one knight give a--

Clown

Would you have a love-song, or a song of good life?

SIR TOBY BELCH

A love-song, a love-song.

SIR ANDREW

Ay, ay: I care not for good life.

Clown

[Sings]O mistress mine, where are you roaming?O, stay and hear; your true love's coming,That can sing both high and low:Trip no further, pretty sweeting;Journeys end in lovers meeting,Every wise man's son doth know.

SIR ANDREW

Excellent good, i' faith.

SIR TOBY BELCH

Good, good.

Clown

[Sings]What is love? 'tis not hereafter;Present mirth hath present laughter;What's to come is still unsure:In delay there lies no plenty;Then come kiss me, sweet and twenty,Youth's a stuff will not endure.

SIR ANDREW

A mellifluous voice, as I am true knight.

SIR TOBY BELCH

A contagious breath.

SIR ANDREW

Very sweet and contagious, i' faith.

SIR TOBY BELCH

To hear by the nose, it is dulcet in contagion.But shall we make the welkin dance indeed? shall werouse the night-owl in a catch that will draw threesouls out of one weaver? shall we do that?

SIR ANDREW

An you love me, let's do't: I am dog at a catch.

Clown

By'r lady, sir, and some dogs will catch well.

SIR ANDREW

Most certain. Let our catch be, 'Thou knave.'

Clown

'Hold thy peace, thou knave,' knight? I shall beconstrained in't to call thee knave, knight.

SIR ANDREW

'Tis not the first time I have constrained one tocall me knave. Begin, fool: it begins 'Hold thy peace.'

Clown

I shall never begin if I hold my peace.

SIR ANDREW

Good, i' faith. Come, begin.Catch sung
Enter MARIA


MARIA

What a caterwauling do you keep here! If my ladyhave not called up her steward Malvolio and bid himturn you out of doors, never trust me.

SIR TOBY BELCH

My lady's a Cataian, we are politicians, Malvolio'sa Peg-a-Ramsey, and 'Three merry men be we.' Am notI consanguineous? am I not of her blood?Tillyvally. Lady!Sings
'There dwelt a man in Babylon, lady, lady!'

Clown

Beshrew me, the knight's in admirable fooling.

SIR ANDREW

Ay, he does well enough if he be disposed, and so doI too: he does it with a better grace, but I do itmore natural.

SIR TOBY BELCH

[Sings]  'O, the twelfth day of December,'--

MARIA

For the love o' God, peace!Enter MALVOLIO


MALVOLIO

My masters, are you mad? or what are you? Have yeno wit, manners, nor honesty, but to gabble liketinkers at this time of night? Do ye make analehouse of my lady's house, that ye squeak out yourcoziers' catches without any mitigation or remorseof voice? Is there no respect of place, persons, nortime in you?

SIR TOBY BELCH

We did keep time, sir, in our catches. Sneck up!

MALVOLIO

Sir Toby, I must be round with you. My lady bade metell you, that, though she harbours you as herkinsman, she's nothing allied to your disorders. Ifyou can separate yourself and your misdemeanors, youare welcome to the house; if not, an it would pleaseyou to take leave of her, she is very willing to bidyou farewell.

SIR TOBY BELCH

'Farewell, dear heart, since I must needs be gone.'

MARIA

Nay, good Sir Toby.

Clown

'His eyes do show his days are almost done.'

MALVOLIO

Is't even so?

SIR TOBY BELCH

'But I will never die.'

Clown

Sir Toby, there you lie.

MALVOLIO

This is much credit to you.

SIR TOBY BELCH

'Shall I bid him go?'

Clown

'What an if you do?'

SIR TOBY BELCH

'Shall I bid him go, and spare not?'

Clown

'O no, no, no, no, you dare not.'

SIR TOBY BELCH

Out o' tune, sir: ye lie. Art any more than asteward? Dost thou think, because thou artvirtuous, there shall be no more cakes and ale?

Clown

Yes, by Saint Anne, and ginger shall be hot i' themouth too.

SIR TOBY BELCH

Thou'rt i' the right. Go, sir, rub your chain withcrumbs. A stoup of wine, Maria!

MALVOLIO

Mistress Mary, if you prized my lady's favour at anything more than contempt, you would not give meansfor this uncivil rule: she shall know of it, by this hand.Exit


MARIA

Go shake your ears.

SIR ANDREW

'Twere as good a deed as to drink when a man'sa-hungry, to challenge him the field, and then tobreak promise with him and make a fool of him.

SIR TOBY BELCH

Do't, knight: I'll write thee a challenge: or I'lldeliver thy indignation to him by word of mouth.

MARIA

Sweet Sir Toby, be patient for tonight: since theyouth of the count's was today with thy lady, she ismuch out of quiet. For Monsieur Malvolio, let mealone with him: if I do not gull him into anayword, and make him a common recreation, do notthink I have wit enough to lie straight in my bed:I know I can do it.

SIR TOBY BELCH

Possess us, possess us; tell us something of him.

MARIA

Marry, sir, sometimes he is a kind of puritan.

SIR ANDREW

O, if I thought that I'ld beat him like a dog!

SIR TOBY BELCH

What, for being a puritan? thy exquisite reason,dear knight?

SIR ANDREW

I have no exquisite reason for't, but I have reasongood enough.

MARIA

The devil a puritan that he is, or any thingconstantly, but a time-pleaser; an affectioned ass,that cons state without book and utters it by greatswarths: the best persuaded of himself, socrammed, as he thinks, with excellencies, that it ishis grounds of faith that all that look on him lovehim; and on that vice in him will my revenge findnotable cause to work.

SIR TOBY BELCH

What wilt thou do?

MARIA

I will drop in his way some obscure epistles oflove; wherein, by the colour of his beard, the shapeof his leg, the manner of his gait, the expressureof his eye, forehead, and complexion, he shall findhimself most feelingly personated. I can write verylike my lady your niece: on a forgotten matter wecan hardly make distinction of our hands.

SIR TOBY BELCH

Excellent! I smell a device.

SIR ANDREW

I have't in my nose too.

SIR TOBY BELCH

He shall think, by the letters that thou wilt drop,that they come from my niece, and that she's inlove with him.

MARIA

My purpose is, indeed, a horse of that colour.

SIR ANDREW

And your horse now would make him an ass.

MARIA

Ass, I doubt not.

SIR ANDREW

O, 'twill be admirable!

MARIA

Sport royal, I warrant you: I know my physic willwork with him. I will plant you two, and let thefool make a third, where he shall find the letter:observe his construction of it. For this night, tobed, and dream on the event. Farewell.Exit


SIR TOBY BELCH

Good night, Penthesilea.

SIR ANDREW

Before me, she's a good wench.

SIR TOBY BELCH

She's a beagle, true-bred, and one that adores me:what o' that?

SIR ANDREW

I was adored once too.

SIR TOBY BELCH

Let's to bed, knight. Thou hadst need send formore money.

SIR ANDREW

If I cannot recover your niece, I am a foul way out.

SIR TOBY BELCH

Send for money, knight: if thou hast her not i'the end, call me cut.

SIR ANDREW

If I do not, never trust me, take it how you will.

SIR TOBY BELCH

Come, come, I'll go burn some sack; 'tis too lateto go to bed now: come, knight; come, knight.Exeunt

SCENE IV. DUKE ORSINO's palace.

Enter DUKE ORSINO, VIOLA, CURIO, and others


DUKE ORSINO

Give me some music. Now, good morrow, friends.Now, good Cesario, but that piece of song,That old and antique song we heard last night:Methought it did relieve my passion much,More than light airs and recollected termsOf these most brisk and giddy-paced times:Come, but one verse.

CURIO

He is not here, so please your lordship that should sing it.

DUKE ORSINO

Who was it?

CURIO

Feste, the jester, my lord; a fool that the ladyOlivia's father took much delight in. He is about the house.

DUKE ORSINO

Seek him out, and play the tune the while.Exit CURIO. Music plays
Come hither, boy: if ever thou shalt love,In the sweet pangs of it remember me;For such as I am all true lovers are,Unstaid and skittish in all motions else,Save in the constant image of the creatureThat is beloved. How dost thou like this tune?

VIOLA

It gives a very echo to the seatWhere Love is throned.

DUKE ORSINO

Thou dost speak masterly:My life upon't, young though thou art, thine eyeHath stay'd upon some favour that it loves:Hath it not, boy?

VIOLA

                  A little, by your favour.

DUKE ORSINO

What kind of woman is't?

VIOLA

Of your complexion.

DUKE ORSINO

She is not worth thee, then. What years, i' faith?

VIOLA

About your years, my lord.

DUKE ORSINO

Too old by heaven: let still the woman takeAn elder than herself: so wears she to him,So sways she level in her husband's heart:For, boy, however we do praise ourselves,Our fancies are more giddy and unfirm,More longing, wavering, sooner lost and worn,Than women's are.

VIOLA

                  I think it well, my lord.

DUKE ORSINO

Then let thy love be younger than thyself,Or thy affection cannot hold the bent;For women are as roses, whose fair flowerBeing once display'd, doth fall that very hour.

VIOLA

And so they are: alas, that they are so;To die, even when they to perfection grow!Re-enter CURIO and Clown


DUKE ORSINO

O, fellow, come, the song we had last night.Mark it, Cesario, it is old and plain;The spinsters and the knitters in the sunAnd the free maids that weave their thread with bonesDo use to chant it: it is silly sooth,And dallies with the innocence of love,Like the old age.

Clown

Are you ready, sir?

DUKE ORSINO

Ay; prithee, sing.Music
SONG.

Clown

Come away, come away, death,And in sad cypress let me be laid;Fly away, fly away breath;I am slain by a fair cruel maid.My shroud of white, stuck all with yew,O, prepare it!My part of death, no one so trueDid share it.Not a flower, not a flower sweetOn my black coffin let there be strown;Not a friend, not a friend greetMy poor corpse, where my bones shall be thrown:A thousand thousand sighs to save,Lay me, O, whereSad true lover never find my grave,To weep there!

DUKE ORSINO

There's for thy pains.

Clown

No pains, sir: I take pleasure in singing, sir.

DUKE ORSINO

I'll pay thy pleasure then.

Clown

Truly, sir, and pleasure will be paid, one time or another.

DUKE ORSINO

Give me now leave to leave thee.

Clown

Now, the melancholy god protect thee; and thetailor make thy doublet of changeable taffeta, forthy mind is a very opal. I would have men of suchconstancy put to sea, that their business might beevery thing and their intent every where; for that'sit that always makes a good voyage of nothing. Farewell.Exit


DUKE ORSINO

Let all the rest give place.CURIO and Attendants retire
Once more, Cesario,Get thee to yond same sovereign cruelty:Tell her, my love, more noble than the world,Prizes not quantity of dirty lands;The parts that fortune hath bestow'd upon her,Tell her, I hold as giddily as fortune;But 'tis that miracle and queen of gemsThat nature pranks her in attracts my soul.

VIOLA

But if she cannot love you, sir?

DUKE ORSINO

I cannot be so answer'd.

VIOLA

Sooth, but you must.Say that some lady, as perhaps there is,Hath for your love a great a pang of heartAs you have for Olivia: you cannot love her;You tell her so; must she not then be answer'd?

DUKE ORSINO

There is no woman's sidesCan bide the beating of so strong a passionAs love doth give my heart; no woman's heartSo big, to hold so much; they lack retentionAlas, their love may be call'd appetite,No motion of the liver, but the palate,That suffer surfeit, cloyment and revolt;But mine is all as hungry as the sea,And can digest as much: make no compareBetween that love a woman can bear meAnd that I owe Olivia.

VIOLA

Ay, but I know--

DUKE ORSINO

What dost thou know?

VIOLA

Too well what love women to men may owe:In faith, they are as true of heart as we.My father had a daughter loved a man,As it might be, perhaps, were I a woman,I should your lordship.

DUKE ORSINO

And what's her history?

VIOLA

A blank, my lord. She never told her love,But let concealment, like a worm i' the bud,Feed on her damask cheek: she pined in thought,And with a green and yellow melancholyShe sat like patience on a monument,Smiling at grief. Was not this love indeed?We men may say more, swear more: but indeedOur shows are more than will; for still we proveMuch in our vows, but little in our love.

DUKE ORSINO

But died thy sister of her love, my boy?

VIOLA

I am all the daughters of my father's house,And all the brothers too: and yet I know not.Sir, shall I to this lady?

DUKE ORSINO

Ay, that's the theme.To her in haste; give her this jewel; say,My love can give no place, bide no denay.Exeunt

SCENE V. OLIVIA's garden.

Enter SIR TOBY BELCH, SIR ANDREW, and FABIAN


SIR TOBY BELCH

Come thy ways, Signior Fabian.

FABIAN

Nay, I'll come: if I lose a scruple of this sport,let me be boiled to death with melancholy.

SIR TOBY BELCH

Wouldst thou not be glad to have the niggardlyrascally sheep-biter come by some notable shame?

FABIAN

I would exult, man: you know, he brought me out o'favour with my lady about a bear-baiting here.

SIR TOBY BELCH

To anger him we'll have the bear again; and we willfool him black and blue: shall we not, Sir Andrew?

SIR ANDREW

An we do not, it is pity of our lives.

SIR TOBY BELCH

Here comes the little villain.Enter MARIA
How now, my metal of India!

MARIA

Get ye all three into the box-tree: Malvolio'scoming down this walk: he has been yonder i' thesun practising behavior to his own shadow this halfhour: observe him, for the love of mockery; for Iknow this letter will make a contemplative idiot ofhim. Close, in the name of jesting! Lie thou there,Throws down a letter
for here comes the trout that must be caught with tickling.Exit
Enter MALVOLIO


MALVOLIO

'Tis but fortune; all is fortune. Maria once toldme she did affect me: and I have heard herself comethus near, that, should she fancy, it should be oneof my complexion. Besides, she uses me with a moreexalted respect than any one else that follows her.What should I think on't?

SIR TOBY BELCH

Here's an overweening rogue!

FABIAN

O, peace! Contemplation makes a rare turkey-cockof him: how he jets under his advanced plumes!

SIR ANDREW

'Slight, I could so beat the rogue!

SIR TOBY BELCH

Peace, I say.

MALVOLIO

To be Count Malvolio!

SIR TOBY BELCH

Ah, rogue!

SIR ANDREW

Pistol him, pistol him.

SIR TOBY BELCH

Peace, peace!

MALVOLIO

There is example for't; the lady of the Strachymarried the yeoman of the wardrobe.

SIR ANDREW

Fie on him, Jezebel!

FABIAN

O, peace! now he's deeply in: look howimagination blows him.

MALVOLIO

Having been three months married to her, sitting inmy state,--

SIR TOBY BELCH

O, for a stone-bow, to hit him in the eye!

MALVOLIO

Calling my officers about me, in my branched velvetgown; having come from a day-bed, where I have leftOlivia sleeping,--

SIR TOBY BELCH

Fire and brimstone!

FABIAN

O, peace, peace!

MALVOLIO

And then to have the humour of state; and after ademure travel of regard, telling them I know myplace as I would they should do theirs, to for mykinsman Toby,--

SIR TOBY BELCH

Bolts and shackles!

FABIAN

O peace, peace, peace! now, now.

MALVOLIO

Seven of my people, with an obedient start, makeout for him: I frown the while; and perchance windup watch, or play with my--some rich jewel. Tobyapproaches; courtesies there to me,--

SIR TOBY BELCH

Shall this fellow live?

FABIAN

Though our silence be drawn from us with cars, yet peace.

MALVOLIO

I extend my hand to him thus, quenching my familiarsmile with an austere regard of control,--

SIR TOBY BELCH

And does not Toby take you a blow o' the lips then?

MALVOLIO

Saying, 'Cousin Toby, my fortunes having cast me onyour niece give me this prerogative of speech,'--

SIR TOBY BELCH

What, what?

MALVOLIO

'You must amend your drunkenness.'

SIR TOBY BELCH

Out, scab!

FABIAN

Nay, patience, or we break the sinews of our plot.

MALVOLIO

'Besides, you waste the treasure of your time witha foolish knight,'--

SIR ANDREW

That's me, I warrant you.

MALVOLIO

'One Sir Andrew,'--

SIR ANDREW

I knew 'twas I; for many do call me fool.

MALVOLIO

What employment have we here?Taking up the letter


FABIAN

Now is the woodcock near the gin.

SIR TOBY BELCH

O, peace! and the spirit of humour intimate readingaloud to him!

MALVOLIO

By my life, this is my lady's hand these be hervery C's, her U's and her T's and thus makes she hergreat P's. It is, in contempt of question, her hand.

SIR ANDREW

Her C's, her U's and her T's: why that?

MALVOLIO

[Reads]  'To the unknown beloved, this, and my goodwishes:'--her very phrases! By your leave, wax.Soft! and the impressure her Lucrece, with which sheuses to seal: 'tis my lady. To whom should this be?

FABIAN

This wins him, liver and all.

MALVOLIO

[Reads]Jove knows I love: But who?Lips, do not move;No man must know.'No man must know.' What follows? the numbersaltered! 'No man must know:' if this should bethee, Malvolio?

SIR TOBY BELCH

Marry, hang thee, brock!

MALVOLIO

[Reads]I may command where I adore;But silence, like a Lucrece knife,With bloodless stroke my heart doth gore:M, O, A, I, doth sway my life.

FABIAN

A fustian riddle!

SIR TOBY BELCH

Excellent wench, say I.

MALVOLIO

'M, O, A, I, doth sway my life.' Nay, but first, letme see, let me see, let me see.

FABIAN

What dish o' poison has she dressed him!

SIR TOBY BELCH

And with what wing the staniel cheques at it!

MALVOLIO

'I may command where I adore.' Why, she may commandme: I serve her; she is my lady. Why, this isevident to any formal capacity; there is noobstruction in this: and the end,--what shouldthat alphabetical position portend? If I could makethat resemble something in me,--Softly! M, O, A,I,--

SIR TOBY BELCH

O, ay, make up that: he is now at a cold scent.

FABIAN

Sowter will cry upon't for all this, though it be asrank as a fox.

MALVOLIO

M,--Malvolio; M,--why, that begins my name.

FABIAN

Did not I say he would work it out? the cur isexcellent at faults.

MALVOLIO

M,--but then there is no consonancy in the sequel;that suffers under probation A should follow but O does.

FABIAN

And O shall end, I hope.

SIR TOBY BELCH

Ay, or I'll cudgel him, and make him cry O!

MALVOLIO

And then I comes behind.

FABIAN

Ay, an you had any eye behind you, you might seemore detraction at your heels than fortunes beforeyou.

MALVOLIO

M, O, A, I; this simulation is not as the former: andyet, to crush this a little, it would bow to me, forevery one of these letters are in my name. Soft!here follows prose.Reads
'If this fall into thy hand, revolve. In my stars Iam above thee; but be not afraid of greatness: someare born great, some achieve greatness, and somehave greatness thrust upon 'em. Thy Fates opentheir hands; let thy blood and spirit embrace them;and, to inure thyself to what thou art like to be,cast thy humble slough and appear fresh. Beopposite with a kinsman, surly with servants; letthy tongue tang arguments of state; put thyself intothe trick of singularity: she thus advises theethat sighs for thee. Remember who commended thyyellow stockings, and wished to see thee evercross-gartered: I say, remember. Go to, thou artmade, if thou desirest to be so; if not, let me seethee a steward still, the fellow of servants, andnot worthy to touch Fortune's fingers. Farewell.She that would alter services with thee,THE FORTUNATE-UNHAPPY.'Daylight and champaign discovers not more: this isopen. I will be proud, I will read politic authors,I will baffle Sir Toby, I will wash off grossacquaintance, I will be point-devise the very man.I do not now fool myself, to let imagination jademe; for every reason excites to this, that my ladyloves me. She did commend my yellow stockings oflate, she did praise my leg being cross-gartered;and in this she manifests herself to my love, andwith a kind of injunction drives me to these habitsof her liking. I thank my stars I am happy. I willbe strange, stout, in yellow stockings, andcross-gartered, even with the swiftness of puttingon. Jove and my stars be praised! Here is yet apostscript.Reads
'Thou canst not choose but know who I am. If thouentertainest my love, let it appear in thy smiling;thy smiles become thee well; therefore in mypresence still smile, dear my sweet, I prithee.'Jove, I thank thee: I will smile; I will doeverything that thou wilt have me.Exit


FABIAN

I will not give my part of this sport for a pensionof thousands to be paid from the Sophy.

SIR TOBY BELCH

I could marry this wench for this device.

SIR ANDREW

So could I too.

SIR TOBY BELCH

And ask no other dowry with her but such another jest.

SIR ANDREW

Nor I neither.

FABIAN

Here comes my noble gull-catcher.Re-enter MARIA


SIR TOBY BELCH

Wilt thou set thy foot o' my neck?

SIR ANDREW

Or o' mine either?

SIR TOBY BELCH

Shall I play my freedom at traytrip, and become thybond-slave?

SIR ANDREW

I' faith, or I either?

SIR TOBY BELCH

Why, thou hast put him in such a dream, that whenthe image of it leaves him he must run mad.

MARIA

Nay, but say true; does it work upon him?

SIR TOBY BELCH

Like aqua-vitae with a midwife.

MARIA

If you will then see the fruits of the sport, markhis first approach before my lady: he will come toher in yellow stockings, and 'tis a colour sheabhors, and cross-gartered, a fashion she detests;and he will smile upon her, which will now be sounsuitable to her disposition, being addicted to amelancholy as she is, that it cannot but turn himinto a notable contempt. If you will see it, followme.

SIR TOBY BELCH

To the gates of Tartar, thou most excellent devil of wit!

SIR ANDREW

I'll make one too.Exeunt

ACT III
SCENE I. OLIVIA's garden.

Enter VIOLA, and Clown with a tabour


VIOLA

Save thee, friend, and thy music: dost thou live bythy tabour?

Clown

No, sir, I live by the church.

VIOLA

Art thou a churchman?

Clown

No such matter, sir: I do live by the church; forI do live at my house, and my house doth stand bythe church.

VIOLA

So thou mayst say, the king lies by a beggar, if abeggar dwell near him; or, the church stands by thytabour, if thy tabour stand by the church.

Clown

You have said, sir. To see this age! A sentence isbut a cheveril glove to a good wit: how quickly thewrong side may be turned outward!

VIOLA

Nay, that's certain; they that dally nicely withwords may quickly make them wanton.

Clown

I would, therefore, my sister had had no name, sir.

VIOLA

Why, man?

Clown

Why, sir, her name's a word; and to dally with thatword might make my sister wanton. But indeed wordsare very rascals since bonds disgraced them.

VIOLA

Thy reason, man?

Clown

Troth, sir, I can yield you none without words; andwords are grown so false, I am loath to provereason with them.

VIOLA

I warrant thou art a merry fellow and carest for nothing.

Clown

Not so, sir, I do care for something; but in myconscience, sir, I do not care for you: if that beto care for nothing, sir, I would it would make you invisible.

VIOLA

Art not thou the Lady Olivia's fool?

Clown

No, indeed, sir; the Lady Olivia has no folly: shewill keep no fool, sir, till she be married; andfools are as like husbands as pilchards are toherrings; the husband's the bigger: I am indeed nother fool, but her corrupter of words.

VIOLA

I saw thee late at the Count Orsino's.

Clown

Foolery, sir, does walk about the orb like the sun,it shines every where. I would be sorry, sir, butthe fool should be as oft with your master as withmy mistress: I think I saw your wisdom there.

VIOLA

Nay, an thou pass upon me, I'll no more with thee.Hold, there's expenses for thee.

Clown

Now Jove, in his next commodity of hair, send thee a beard!

VIOLA

By my troth, I'll tell thee, I am almost sick forone;Aside
though I would not have it grow on my chin. Is thylady within?

Clown

Would not a pair of these have bred, sir?

VIOLA

Yes, being kept together and put to use.

Clown

I would play Lord Pandarus of Phrygia, sir, to bringa Cressida to this Troilus.

VIOLA

I understand you, sir; 'tis well begged.

Clown

The matter, I hope, is not great, sir, begging buta beggar: Cressida was a beggar. My lady iswithin, sir. I will construe to them whence youcome; who you are and what you would are out of mywelkin, I might say 'element,' but the word is over-worn.Exit


VIOLA

This fellow is wise enough to play the fool;And to do that well craves a kind of wit:He must observe their mood on whom he jests,The quality of persons, and the time,And, like the haggard, cheque at every featherThat comes before his eye. This is a practiseAs full of labour as a wise man's artFor folly that he wisely shows is fit;But wise men, folly-fall'n, quite taint their wit.Enter SIR TOBY BELCH, and SIR ANDREW


SIR TOBY BELCH

Save you, gentleman.

VIOLA

And you, sir.

SIR ANDREW

Dieu vous garde, monsieur.

VIOLA

Et vous aussi; votre serviteur.

SIR ANDREW

I hope, sir, you are; and I am yours.

SIR TOBY BELCH

Will you encounter the house? my niece is desirousyou should enter, if your trade be to her.

VIOLA

I am bound to your niece, sir; I mean, she is thelist of my voyage.

SIR TOBY BELCH

Taste your legs, sir; put them to motion.

VIOLA

My legs do better understand me, sir, than Iunderstand what you mean by bidding me taste my legs.

SIR TOBY BELCH

I mean, to go, sir, to enter.

VIOLA

I will answer you with gait and entrance. But weare prevented.Enter OLIVIA and MARIA
Most excellent accomplished lady, the heavens rainodours on you!

SIR ANDREW

That youth's a rare courtier: 'Rain odours;' well.

VIOLA

My matter hath no voice, to your own most pregnantand vouchsafed ear.

SIR ANDREW

'Odours,' 'pregnant' and 'vouchsafed:' I'll get 'emall three all ready.

OLIVIA

Let the garden door be shut, and leave me to my hearing.Exeunt SIR TOBY BELCH, SIR ANDREW, and MARIA
Give me your hand, sir.

VIOLA

My duty, madam, and most humble service.

OLIVIA

What is your name?

VIOLA

Cesario is your servant's name, fair princess.

OLIVIA

My servant, sir! 'Twas never merry worldSince lowly feigning was call'd compliment:You're servant to the Count Orsino, youth.

VIOLA

And he is yours, and his must needs be yours:Your servant's servant is your servant, madam.

OLIVIA

For him, I think not on him: for his thoughts,Would they were blanks, rather than fill'd with me!

VIOLA

Madam, I come to whet your gentle thoughtsOn his behalf.

OLIVIA

                  O, by your leave, I pray you,I bade you never speak again of him:But, would you undertake another suit,I had rather hear you to solicit thatThan music from the spheres.

VIOLA

Dear lady,--

OLIVIA

Give me leave, beseech you. I did send,After the last enchantment you did here,A ring in chase of you: so did I abuseMyself, my servant and, I fear me, you:Under your hard construction must I sit,To force that on you, in a shameful cunning,Which you knew none of yours: what might you think?Have you not set mine honour at the stakeAnd baited it with all the unmuzzled thoughtsThat tyrannous heart can think? To one of your receivingEnough is shown: a cypress, not a bosom,Hideth my heart. So, let me hear you speak.

VIOLA

I pity you.

OLIVIA

          That's a degree to love.

VIOLA

No, not a grize; for 'tis a vulgar proof,That very oft we pity enemies.

OLIVIA

Why, then, methinks 'tis time to smile again.O, world, how apt the poor are to be proud!If one should be a prey, how much the betterTo fall before the lion than the wolf!Clock strikes
The clock upbraids me with the waste of time.Be not afraid, good youth, I will not have you:And yet, when wit and youth is come to harvest,Your were is alike to reap a proper man:There lies your way, due west.

VIOLA

Then westward-ho! Grace and good dispositionAttend your ladyship!You'll nothing, madam, to my lord by me?

OLIVIA

Stay:I prithee, tell me what thou thinkest of me.

VIOLA

That you do think you are not what you are.

OLIVIA

If I think so, I think the same of you.

VIOLA

Then think you right: I am not what I am.

OLIVIA

I would you were as I would have you be!

VIOLA

Would it be better, madam, than I am?I wish it might, for now I am your fool.

OLIVIA

O, what a deal of scorn looks beautifulIn the contempt and anger of his lip!A murderous guilt shows not itself more soonThan love that would seem hid: love's night is noon.Cesario, by the roses of the spring,By maidhood, honour, truth and every thing,I love thee so, that, maugre all thy pride,Nor wit nor reason can my passion hide.Do not extort thy reasons from this clause,For that I woo, thou therefore hast no cause,But rather reason thus with reason fetter,Love sought is good, but given unsought better.

VIOLA

By innocence I swear, and by my youthI have one heart, one bosom and one truth,And that no woman has; nor never noneShall mistress be of it, save I alone.And so adieu, good madam: never moreWill I my master's tears to you deplore.

OLIVIA

Yet come again; for thou perhaps mayst moveThat heart, which now abhors, to like his love.Exeunt

SCENE II. OLIVIA's house.

Enter SIR TOBY BELCH, SIR ANDREW, and FABIAN


SIR ANDREW

No, faith, I'll not stay a jot longer.

SIR TOBY BELCH

Thy reason, dear venom, give thy reason.

FABIAN

You must needs yield your reason, Sir Andrew.

SIR ANDREW

Marry, I saw your niece do more favours to thecount's serving-man than ever she bestowed upon me;I saw't i' the orchard.

SIR TOBY BELCH

Did she see thee the while, old boy? tell me that.

SIR ANDREW

As plain as I see you now.

FABIAN

This was a great argument of love in her toward you.

SIR ANDREW

'Slight, will you make an ass o' me?

FABIAN

I will prove it legitimate, sir, upon the oaths ofjudgment and reason.

SIR TOBY BELCH

And they have been grand-jury-men since before Noahwas a sailor.

FABIAN

She did show favour to the youth in your sight onlyto exasperate you, to awake your dormouse valour, toput fire in your heart and brimstone in your liver.You should then have accosted her; and with someexcellent jests, fire-new from the mint, you shouldhave banged the youth into dumbness. This waslooked for at your hand, and this was balked: thedouble gilt of this opportunity you let time washoff, and you are now sailed into the north of mylady's opinion; where you will hang like an icicleon a Dutchman's beard, unless you do redeem it bysome laudable attempt either of valour or policy.

SIR ANDREW

An't be any way, it must be with valour; for policyI hate: I had as lief be a Brownist as apolitician.

SIR TOBY BELCH

Why, then, build me thy fortunes upon the basis ofvalour. Challenge me the count's youth to fightwith him; hurt him in eleven places: my niece shalltake note of it; and assure thyself, there is nolove-broker in the world can more prevail in man'scommendation with woman than report of valour.

FABIAN

There is no way but this, Sir Andrew.

SIR ANDREW

Will either of you bear me a challenge to him?

SIR TOBY BELCH

Go, write it in a martial hand; be curst and brief;it is no matter how witty, so it be eloquent and funof invention: taunt him with the licence of ink:if thou thou'st him some thrice, it shall not beamiss; and as many lies as will lie in thy sheet ofpaper, although the sheet were big enough for thebed of Ware in England, set 'em down: go, about it.Let there be gall enough in thy ink, though thouwrite with a goose-pen, no matter: about it.

SIR ANDREW

Where shall I find you?

SIR TOBY BELCH

We'll call thee at the cubiculo: go.Exit SIR ANDREW


FABIAN

This is a dear manikin to you, Sir Toby.

SIR TOBY BELCH

I have been dear to him, lad, some two thousandstrong, or so.

FABIAN

We shall have a rare letter from him: but you'llnot deliver't?

SIR TOBY BELCH

Never trust me, then; and by all means stir on theyouth to an answer. I think oxen and wainropescannot hale them together. For Andrew, if he wereopened, and you find so much blood in his liver aswill clog the foot of a flea, I'll eat the rest ofthe anatomy.

FABIAN

And his opposite, the youth, bears in his visage nogreat presage of cruelty.Enter MARIA


SIR TOBY BELCH

Look, where the youngest wren of nine comes.

MARIA

If you desire the spleen, and will laugh yourselfinto stitches, follow me. Yond gull Malvolio isturned heathen, a very renegado; for there is noChristian, that means to be saved by believingrightly, can ever believe such impossible passagesof grossness. He's in yellow stockings.

SIR TOBY BELCH

And cross-gartered?

MARIA

Most villanously; like a pedant that keeps a schooli' the church. I have dogged him, like hismurderer. He does obey every point of the letterthat I dropped to betray him: he does smile hisface into more lines than is in the new map with theaugmentation of the Indies: you have not seen sucha thing as 'tis. I can hardly forbear hurling thingsat him. I know my lady will strike him: if she do,he'll smile and take't for a great favour.

SIR TOBY BELCH

Come, bring us, bring us where he is.Exeunt

SCENE III. A street.

Enter SEBASTIAN and ANTONIO


SEBASTIAN

I would not by my will have troubled you;But, since you make your pleasure of your pains,I will no further chide you.

ANTONIO

I could not stay behind you: my desire,More sharp than filed steel, did spur me forth;And not all love to see you, though so muchAs might have drawn one to a longer voyage,But jealousy what might befall your travel,Being skilless in these parts; which to a stranger,Unguided and unfriended, often proveRough and unhospitable: my willing love,The rather by these arguments of fear,Set forth in your pursuit.

SEBASTIAN

My kind Antonio,I can no other answer make but thanks,And thanks; and ever [         ] oft good turnsAre shuffled off with such uncurrent pay:But, were my worth as is my conscience firm,You should find better dealing. What's to do?Shall we go see the reliques of this town?

ANTONIO

To-morrow, sir: best first go see your lodging.

SEBASTIAN

I am not weary, and 'tis long to night:I pray you, let us satisfy our eyesWith the memorials and the things of fameThat do renown this city.

ANTONIO

Would you'ld pardon me;I do not without danger walk these streets:Once, in a sea-fight, 'gainst the count his galleysI did some service; of such note indeed,That were I ta'en here it would scarce be answer'd.

SEBASTIAN

Belike you slew great number of his people.

ANTONIO

The offence is not of such a bloody nature;Albeit the quality of the time and quarrelMight well have given us bloody argument.It might have since been answer'd in repayingWhat we took from them; which, for traffic's sake,Most of our city did: only myself stood out;For which, if I be lapsed in this place,I shall pay dear.

SEBASTIAN

                  Do not then walk too open.

ANTONIO

It doth not fit me. Hold, sir, here's my purse.In the south suburbs, at the Elephant,Is best to lodge: I will bespeak our diet,Whiles you beguile the time and feed your knowledgeWith viewing of the town: there shall you have me.

SEBASTIAN

Why I your purse?

ANTONIO

Haply your eye shall light upon some toyYou have desire to purchase; and your store,I think, is not for idle markets, sir.

SEBASTIAN

I'll be your purse-bearer and leave youFor an hour.

ANTONIO

To the Elephant.

SEBASTIAN

                  I do remember.Exeunt

SCENE IV. OLIVIA's garden.

Enter OLIVIA and MARIA


OLIVIA

I have sent after him: he says he'll come;How shall I feast him? what bestow of him?For youth is bought more oft than begg'd or borrow'd.I speak too loud.Where is Malvolio? he is sad and civil,And suits well for a servant with my fortunes:Where is Malvolio?

MARIA

He's coming, madam; but in very strange manner. Heis, sure, possessed, madam.

OLIVIA

Why, what's the matter? does he rave?

MARIA

No. madam, he does nothing but smile: yourladyship were best to have some guard about you, ifhe come; for, sure, the man is tainted in's wits.

OLIVIA

Go call him hither.Exit MARIA
I am as mad as he,If sad and merry madness equal be.Re-enter MARIA, with MALVOLIO
How now, Malvolio!

MALVOLIO

Sweet lady, ho, ho.

OLIVIA

Smilest thou?I sent for thee upon a sad occasion.

MALVOLIO

Sad, lady! I could be sad: this does make someobstruction in the blood, this cross-gartering; butwhat of that? if it please the eye of one, it iswith me as the very true sonnet is, 'Please one, andplease all.'

OLIVIA

Why, how dost thou, man? what is the matter with thee?

MALVOLIO

Not black in my mind, though yellow in my legs. Itdid come to his hands, and commands shall beexecuted: I think we do know the sweet Roman hand.

OLIVIA

Wilt thou go to bed, Malvolio?

MALVOLIO

To bed! ay, sweet-heart, and I'll come to thee.

OLIVIA

God comfort thee! Why dost thou smile so and kissthy hand so oft?

MARIA

How do you, Malvolio?

MALVOLIO

At your request! yes; nightingales answer daws.

MARIA

Why appear you with this ridiculous boldness before my lady?

MALVOLIO

'Be not afraid of greatness:' 'twas well writ.

OLIVIA

What meanest thou by that, Malvolio?

MALVOLIO

'Some are born great,'--

OLIVIA

Ha!

MALVOLIO

'Some achieve greatness,'--

OLIVIA

What sayest thou?

MALVOLIO

'And some have greatness thrust upon them.'

OLIVIA

Heaven restore thee!

MALVOLIO

'Remember who commended thy yellow stocking s,'--

OLIVIA

Thy yellow stockings!

MALVOLIO

'And wished to see thee cross-gartered.'

OLIVIA

Cross-gartered!

MALVOLIO

'Go to thou art made, if thou desirest to be so;'--

OLIVIA

Am I made?

MALVOLIO

'If not, let me see thee a servant still.'

OLIVIA

Why, this is very midsummer madness.Enter Servant


Servant

Madam, the young gentleman of the Count Orsino's isreturned: I could hardly entreat him back: heattends your ladyship's pleasure.

OLIVIA

I'll come to him.Exit Servant
Good Maria, let this fellow be looked to. Where'smy cousin Toby? Let some of my people have a specialcare of him: I would not have him miscarry for thehalf of my dowry.Exeunt OLIVIA and MARIA


MALVOLIO

O, ho! do you come near me now? no worse man thanSir Toby to look to me! This concurs directly withthe letter: she sends him on purpose, that I mayappear stubborn to him; for she incites me to thatin the letter. 'Cast thy humble slough,' says she;'be opposite with a kinsman, surly with servants;let thy tongue tang with arguments of state; putthyself into the trick of singularity;' andconsequently sets down the manner how; as, a sadface, a reverend carriage, a slow tongue, in thehabit of some sir of note, and so forth. I havelimed her; but it is Jove's doing, and Jove make methankful! And when she went away now, 'Let thisfellow be looked to:' fellow! not Malvolio, norafter my degree, but fellow. Why, every thingadheres together, that no dram of a scruple, noscruple of a scruple, no obstacle, no incredulousor unsafe circumstance--What can be said? Nothingthat can be can come between me and the fullprospect of my hopes. Well, Jove, not I, is thedoer of this, and he is to be thanked.Re-enter MARIA, with SIR TOBY BELCH and FABIAN


SIR TOBY BELCH

Which way is he, in the name of sanctity? If allthe devils of hell be drawn in little, and Legionhimself possessed him, yet I'll speak to him.

FABIAN

Here he is, here he is. How is't with you, sir?how is't with you, man?

MALVOLIO

Go off; I discard you: let me enjoy my private: gooff.

MARIA

Lo, how hollow the fiend speaks within him! did notI tell you? Sir Toby, my lady prays you to have acare of him.

MALVOLIO

Ah, ha! does she so?

SIR TOBY BELCH

Go to, go to; peace, peace; we must deal gentlywith him: let me alone. How do you, Malvolio? howis't with you? What, man! defy the devil:consider, he's an enemy to mankind.

MALVOLIO

Do you know what you say?

MARIA

La you, an you speak ill of the devil, how he takesit at heart! Pray God, he be not bewitched!

FABIAN

Carry his water to the wise woman.

MARIA

Marry, and it shall be done to-morrow morning, if Ilive. My lady would not lose him for more than I'll say.

MALVOLIO

How now, mistress!

MARIA

O Lord!

SIR TOBY BELCH

Prithee, hold thy peace; this is not the way: doyou not see you move him? let me alone with him.

FABIAN

No way but gentleness; gently, gently: the fiend isrough, and will not be roughly used.

SIR TOBY BELCH

Why, how now, my bawcock! how dost thou, chuck?

MALVOLIO

Sir!

SIR TOBY BELCH

Ay, Biddy, come with me. What, man! 'tis not forgravity to play at cherry-pit with Satan: hanghim, foul collier!

MARIA

Get him to say his prayers, good Sir Toby, get him to pray.

MALVOLIO

My prayers, minx!

MARIA

No, I warrant you, he will not hear of godliness.

MALVOLIO

Go, hang yourselves all! you are idle shallowthings: I am not of your element: you shall knowmore hereafter.Exit


SIR TOBY BELCH

Is't possible?

FABIAN

If this were played upon a stage now, I couldcondemn it as an improbable fiction.

SIR TOBY BELCH

His very genius hath taken the infection of the device, man.

MARIA

Nay, pursue him now, lest the device take air and taint.

FABIAN

Why, we shall make him mad indeed.

MARIA

The house will be the quieter.

SIR TOBY BELCH

Come, we'll have him in a dark room and bound. Myniece is already in the belief that he's mad: wemay carry it thus, for our pleasure and his penance,till our very pastime, tired out of breath, promptus to have mercy on him: at which time we willbring the device to the bar and crown thee for afinder of madmen. But see, but see.Enter SIR ANDREW


FABIAN

More matter for a May morning.

SIR ANDREW

Here's the challenge, read it: warrant there'svinegar and pepper in't.

FABIAN

Is't so saucy?

SIR ANDREW

Ay, is't, I warrant him: do but read.

SIR TOBY BELCH

Give me.Reads
'Youth, whatsoever thou art, thou art but a scurvy fellow.'

FABIAN

Good, and valiant.

SIR TOBY BELCH

[Reads]  'Wonder not, nor admire not in thy mind,why I do call thee so, for I will show thee no reason for't.'

FABIAN

A good note; that keeps you from the blow of the law.

SIR TOBY BELCH

[Reads]  'Thou comest to the lady Olivia, and in mysight she uses thee kindly: but thou liest in thythroat; that is not the matter I challenge thee for.'

FABIAN

Very brief, and to exceeding good sense--less.

SIR TOBY BELCH

[Reads]  'I will waylay thee going home; where if itbe thy chance to kill me,'--

FABIAN

Good.

SIR TOBY BELCH

[Reads]  'Thou killest me like a rogue and a villain.'

FABIAN

Still you keep o' the windy side of the law: good.

SIR TOBY BELCH

[Reads]  'Fare thee well; and God have mercy uponone of our souls! He may have mercy upon mine; butmy hope is better, and so look to thyself. Thyfriend, as thou usest him, and thy sworn enemy,ANDREW AGUECHEEK.If this letter move him not, his legs cannot:I'll give't him.

MARIA

You may have very fit occasion for't: he is now insome commerce with my lady, and will by and by depart.

SIR TOBY BELCH

Go, Sir Andrew: scout me for him at the corner theorchard like a bum-baily: so soon as ever thou seesthim, draw; and, as thou drawest swear horrible; forit comes to pass oft that a terrible oath, with aswaggering accent sharply twanged off, gives manhoodmore approbation than ever proof itself would haveearned him. Away!

SIR ANDREW

Nay, let me alone for swearing.Exit


SIR TOBY BELCH

Now will not I deliver his letter: for the behaviorof the young gentleman gives him out to be of goodcapacity and breeding; his employment between hislord and my niece confirms no less: therefore thisletter, being so excellently ignorant, will breed noterror in the youth: he will find it comes from aclodpole. But, sir, I will deliver his challenge byword of mouth; set upon Aguecheek a notable reportof valour; and drive the gentleman, as I know hisyouth will aptly receive it, into a most hideousopinion of his rage, skill, fury and impetuosity.This will so fright them both that they will killone another by the look, like cockatrices.Re-enter OLIVIA, with VIOLA


FABIAN

Here he comes with your niece: give them way tillhe take leave, and presently after him.

SIR TOBY BELCH

I will meditate the while upon some horrid messagefor a challenge.Exeunt SIR TOBY BELCH, FABIAN, and MARIA


OLIVIA

I have said too much unto a heart of stoneAnd laid mine honour too unchary out:There's something in me that reproves my fault;But such a headstrong potent fault it is,That it but mocks reproof.

VIOLA

With the same 'havior that your passion bearsGoes on my master's grief.

OLIVIA

Here, wear this jewel for me, 'tis my picture;Refuse it not; it hath no tongue to vex you;And I beseech you come again to-morrow.What shall you ask of me that I'll deny,That honour saved may upon asking give?

VIOLA

Nothing but this; your true love for my master.

OLIVIA

How with mine honour may I give him thatWhich I have given to you?

VIOLA

I will acquit you.

OLIVIA

Well, come again to-morrow: fare thee well:A fiend like thee might bear my soul to hell.Exit
Re-enter SIR TOBY BELCH and FABIAN


SIR TOBY BELCH

Gentleman, God save thee.

VIOLA

And you, sir.

SIR TOBY BELCH

That defence thou hast, betake thee to't: of whatnature the wrongs are thou hast done him, I knownot; but thy intercepter, full of despite, bloody asthe hunter, attends thee at the orchard-end:dismount thy tuck, be yare in thy preparation, forthy assailant is quick, skilful and deadly.

VIOLA

You mistake, sir; I am sure no man hath any quarrelto me: my remembrance is very free and clear fromany image of offence done to any man.

SIR TOBY BELCH

You'll find it otherwise, I assure you: therefore,if you hold your life at any price, betake you toyour guard; for your opposite hath in him whatyouth, strength, skill and wrath can furnish man withal.

VIOLA

I pray you, sir, what is he?

SIR TOBY BELCH

He is knight, dubbed with unhatched rapier and oncarpet consideration; but he is a devil in privatebrawl: souls and bodies hath he divorced three; andhis incensement at this moment is so implacable,that satisfaction can be none but by pangs of deathand sepulchre. Hob, nob, is his word; give't or take't.

VIOLA

I will return again into the house and desire someconduct of the lady. I am no fighter. I have heardof some kind of men that put quarrels purposely onothers, to taste their valour: belike this is a manof that quirk.

SIR TOBY BELCH

Sir, no; his indignation derives itself out of avery competent injury: therefore, get you on andgive him his desire. Back you shall not to thehouse, unless you undertake that with me which withas much safety you might answer him: therefore, on,or strip your sword stark naked; for meddle youmust, that's certain, or forswear to wear iron about you.

VIOLA

This is as uncivil as strange. I beseech you, do methis courteous office, as to know of the knight whatmy offence to him is: it is something of mynegligence, nothing of my purpose.

SIR TOBY BELCH

I will do so. Signior Fabian, stay you by thisgentleman till my return.Exit


VIOLA

Pray you, sir, do you know of this matter?

FABIAN

I know the knight is incensed against you, even to amortal arbitrement; but nothing of the circumstance more.

VIOLA

I beseech you, what manner of man is he?

FABIAN

Nothing of that wonderful promise, to read him byhis form, as you are like to find him in the proofof his valour. He is, indeed, sir, the most skilful,bloody and fatal opposite that you could possiblyhave found in any part of Illyria. Will you walktowards him? I will make your peace with him if Ican.

VIOLA

I shall be much bound to you for't: I am one thathad rather go with sir priest than sir knight: Icare not who knows so much of my mettle.Exeunt
Re-enter SIR TOBY BELCH, with SIR ANDREW


SIR TOBY BELCH

Why, man, he's a very devil; I have not seen such afirago. I had a pass with him, rapier, scabbard andall, and he gives me the stuck in with such a mortalmotion, that it is inevitable; and on the answer, hepays you as surely as your feet hit the ground theystep on. They say he has been fencer to the Sophy.

SIR ANDREW

Pox on't, I'll not meddle with him.

SIR TOBY BELCH

Ay, but he will not now be pacified: Fabian canscarce hold him yonder.

SIR ANDREW

Plague on't, an I thought he had been valiant and socunning in fence, I'ld have seen him damned ere I'ldhave challenged him. Let him let the matter slip,and I'll give him my horse, grey Capilet.

SIR TOBY BELCH

I'll make the motion: stand here, make a good showon't: this shall end without the perdition of souls.Aside
Marry, I'll ride your horse as well as I ride you.Re-enter FABIAN and VIOLA
To FABIAN
I have his horse to take up the quarrel:I have persuaded him the youth's a devil.

FABIAN

He is as horribly conceited of him; and pants andlooks pale, as if a bear were at his heels.

SIR TOBY BELCH

[To VIOLA]  There's no remedy, sir; he will fightwith you for's oath sake: marry, he hath betterbethought him of his quarrel, and he finds that nowscarce to be worth talking of: therefore draw, forthe supportance of his vow; he protests he will not hurt you.

VIOLA

[Aside]  Pray God defend me! A little thing wouldmake me tell them how much I lack of a man.

FABIAN

Give ground, if you see him furious.

SIR TOBY BELCH

Come, Sir Andrew, there's no remedy; the gentlemanwill, for his honour's sake, have one bout with you;he cannot by the duello avoid it: but he haspromised me, as he is a gentleman and a soldier, hewill not hurt you. Come on; to't.

SIR ANDREW

Pray God, he keep his oath!

I do assure you, 'tis against my will.They draw

Second Officer

Antonio, I arrest thee at the suit of Count Orsino.

No, sir, no jot; I know your favour well,Though now you have no sea-cap on your head.Take him away: he knows I know him well.

ANTONIO

I must obey.To VIOLA
This comes with seeking you:But there's no remedy; I shall answer it.What will you do, now my necessityMakes me to ask you for my purse? It grieves meMuch more for what I cannot do for youThan what befalls myself. You stand amazed;But be of comfort.

I must entreat of you some of that money.

What money, sir?For the fair kindness you have show'd me here,And, part, being prompted by your present trouble,Out of my lean and low abilityI'll lend you something: my having is not much;I'll make division of my present with you:Hold, there's half my coffer.

ANTONIO

Will you deny me now?Is't possible that my deserts to youCan lack persuasion? Do not tempt my misery,Lest that it make me so unsound a manAs to upbraid you with those kindnessesThat I have done for you.

VIOLA

I know of none;Nor know I you by voice or any feature:I hate ingratitude more in a manThan lying, vainness, babbling, drunkenness,Or any taint of vice whose strong corruptionInhabits our frail blood.

ANTONIO

O heavens themselves!

Second Officer

Come, sir, I pray you, go.

ANTONIO

Let me speak a little. This youth that you see hereI snatch'd one half out of the jaws of death,Relieved him with such sanctity of love,And to his image, which methought did promiseMost venerable worth, did I devotion.

First Officer

What's that to us? The time goes by: away!

ANTONIO

But O how vile an idol proves this godThou hast, Sebastian, done good feature shame.In nature there's no blemish but the mind;None can be call'd deform'd but the unkind:Virtue is beauty, but the beauteous evilAre empty trunks o'erflourish'd by the devil.

First Officer

The man grows mad: away with him! Come, come, sir.

ANTONIO

Lead me on.Exit with Officers


VIOLA

Methinks his words do from such passion fly,That he believes himself: so do not I.Prove true, imagination, O, prove true,That I, dear brother, be now ta'en for you!

SIR TOBY BELCH

Come hither, knight; come hither, Fabian: we'llwhisper o'er a couplet or two of most sage saws.

VIOLA

He named Sebastian: I my brother knowYet living in my glass; even such and soIn favour was my brother, and he wentStill in this fashion, colour, ornament,For him I imitate: O, if it prove,Tempests are kind and salt waves fresh in love.Exit


SIR TOBY BELCH

A very dishonest paltry boy, and more a coward thana hare: his dishonesty appears in leaving hisfriend here in necessity and denying him; and forhis cowardship, ask Fabian.

FABIAN

A coward, a most devout coward, religious in it.

SIR ANDREW

'Slid, I'll after him again and beat him.

SIR TOBY BELCH

Do; cuff him soundly, but never draw thy sword.

SIR ANDREW

An I do not,--

FABIAN

Come, let's see the event.

SIR TOBY BELCH

I dare lay any money 'twill be nothing yet.Exeunt

ACT IV
SCENE I. Before OLIVIA's house.

Enter SEBASTIAN and Clown


Clown

Will you make me believe that I am not sent for you?

SEBASTIAN

Go to, go to, thou art a foolish fellow:Let me be clear of thee.

Clown

Well held out, i' faith! No, I do not know you; norI am not sent to you by my lady, to bid you comespeak with her; nor your name is not Master Cesario;nor this is not my nose neither. Nothing that is so is so.

SEBASTIAN

I prithee, vent thy folly somewhere else: Thouknow'st not me.

Clown

Vent my folly! he has heard that word of somegreat man and now applies it to a fool. Vent myfolly! I am afraid this great lubber, the world,will prove a cockney. I prithee now, ungird thystrangeness and tell me what I shall vent to mylady: shall I vent to her that thou art coming?

SEBASTIAN

I prithee, foolish Greek, depart from me: There'smoney for thee: if you tarry longer, I shall giveworse payment.

Clown

By my troth, thou hast an open hand. These wise menthat give fools money get themselves a goodreport--after fourteen years' purchase.Enter SIR ANDREW, SIR TOBY BELCH, and FABIAN


SIR ANDREW

Now, sir, have I met you again? there's for you.

SEBASTIAN

Why, there's for thee, and there, and there. Are allthe people mad?

SIR TOBY BELCH

Hold, sir, or I'll throw your dagger o'er the house.

Clown

This will I tell my lady straight: I would not bein some of your coats for two pence.Exit


SIR TOBY BELCH

Come on, sir; hold.

SIR ANDREW

Nay, let him alone: I'll go another way to workwith him; I'll have an action of battery againsthim, if there be any law in Illyria: though Istruck him first, yet it's no matter for that.

SEBASTIAN

Let go thy hand.

SIR TOBY BELCH

Come, sir, I will not let you go. Come, my youngsoldier, put up your iron: you are well fleshed; come on.

SEBASTIAN

I will be free from thee. What wouldst thou now? Ifthou darest tempt me further, draw thy sword.

SIR TOBY BELCH

What, what? Nay, then I must have an ounce or twoof this malapert blood from you.Enter OLIVIA


OLIVIA

Hold, Toby; on thy life I charge thee, hold!

SIR TOBY BELCH

Madam!

OLIVIA

Will it be ever thus? Ungracious wretch,Fit for the mountains and the barbarous caves,Where manners ne'er were preach'd! out of my sight!Be not offended, dear Cesario.Rudesby, be gone!Exeunt SIR TOBY BELCH, SIR ANDREW, and FABIAN
I prithee, gentle friend,Let thy fair wisdom, not thy passion, swayIn this uncivil and thou unjust extentAgainst thy peace. Go with me to my house,And hear thou there how many fruitless pranksThis ruffian hath botch'd up, that thou therebyMayst smile at this: thou shalt not choose but go:Do not deny. Beshrew his soul for me,He started one poor heart of mine in thee.

SEBASTIAN

What relish is in this? how runs the stream?Or I am mad, or else this is a dream:Let fancy still my sense in Lethe steep;If it be thus to dream, still let me sleep!

OLIVIA

Nay, come, I prithee; would thou'ldst be ruled by me!

SEBASTIAN

Madam, I will.

OLIVIA

                  O, say so, and so be!Exeunt

SCENE II. OLIVIA's house.

Enter MARIA and Clown


MARIA

Nay, I prithee, put on this gown and this beard;make him believe thou art Sir Topas the curate: doit quickly; I'll call Sir Toby the whilst.Exit


Clown

Well, I'll put it on, and I will dissemble myselfin't; and I would I were the first that everdissembled in such a gown. I am not tall enough tobecome the function well, nor lean enough to bethought a good student; but to be said an honest manand a good housekeeper goes as fairly as to say acareful man and a great scholar. The competitors enter.Enter SIR TOBY BELCH and MARIA


SIR TOBY BELCH

Jove bless thee, master Parson.

Clown

Bonos dies, Sir Toby: for, as the old hermit ofPrague, that never saw pen and ink, very wittilysaid to a niece of King Gorboduc, 'That that is is;'so I, being Master Parson, am Master Parson; for,what is 'that' but 'that,' and 'is' but 'is'?

SIR TOBY BELCH

To him, Sir Topas.

Clown

What, ho, I say! peace in this prison!

SIR TOBY BELCH

The knave counterfeits well; a good knave.

MALVOLIO

[Within]  Who calls there?

Clown

Sir Topas the curate, who comes to visit Malvoliothe lunatic.

MALVOLIO

Sir Topas, Sir Topas, good Sir Topas, go to my lady.

Clown

Out, hyperbolical fiend! how vexest thou this man!talkest thou nothing but of ladies?

SIR TOBY BELCH

Well said, Master Parson.

MALVOLIO

Sir Topas, never was man thus wronged: good SirTopas, do not think I am mad: they have laid mehere in hideous darkness.

Clown

Fie, thou dishonest Satan! I call thee by the mostmodest terms; for I am one of those gentle onesthat will use the devil himself with courtesy:sayest thou that house is dark?

MALVOLIO

As hell, Sir Topas.

Clown

Why it hath bay windows transparent as barricadoes,and the clearstores toward the south north are aslustrous as ebony; and yet complainest thou ofobstruction?

MALVOLIO

I am not mad, Sir Topas: I say to you, this house is dark.

Clown

Madman, thou errest: I say, there is no darknessbut ignorance; in which thou art more puzzled thanthe Egyptians in their fog.

MALVOLIO

I say, this house is as dark as ignorance, thoughignorance were as dark as hell; and I say, therewas never man thus abused. I am no more mad than youare: make the trial of it in any constant question.

Clown

What is the opinion of Pythagoras concerning wild fowl?

MALVOLIO

That the soul of our grandam might haply inhabit a bird.

Clown

What thinkest thou of his opinion?

MALVOLIO

I think nobly of the soul, and no way approve his opinion.

Clown

Fare thee well. Remain thou still in darkness:thou shalt hold the opinion of Pythagoras ere I willallow of thy wits, and fear to kill a woodcock, lestthou dispossess the soul of thy grandam. Fare thee well.

MALVOLIO

Sir Topas, Sir Topas!

SIR TOBY BELCH

My most exquisite Sir Topas!

Clown

Nay, I am for all waters.

MARIA

Thou mightst have done this without thy beard andgown: he sees thee not.

SIR TOBY BELCH

To him in thine own voice, and bring me word howthou findest him: I would we were well rid of thisknavery. If he may be conveniently delivered, Iwould he were, for I am now so far in offence withmy niece that I cannot pursue with any safety thissport to the upshot. Come by and by to my chamber.Exeunt SIR TOBY BELCH and MARIA


Clown

[Singing]'Hey, Robin, jolly Robin,Tell me how thy lady does.'

MALVOLIO

Fool!

Clown

'My lady is unkind, perdy.'

MALVOLIO

Fool!

Clown

'Alas, why is she so?'

MALVOLIO

Fool, I say!

Clown

'She loves another'--Who calls, ha?

MALVOLIO

Good fool, as ever thou wilt deserve well at myhand, help me to a candle, and pen, ink and paper:as I am a gentleman, I will live to be thankful tothee for't.

Clown

Master Malvolio?

MALVOLIO

Ay, good fool.

Clown

Alas, sir, how fell you besides your five wits?

MALVOLIO

Fool, there was never a man so notoriously abused: Iam as well in my wits, fool, as thou art.

Clown

But as well? then you are mad indeed, if you be nobetter in your wits than a fool.

MALVOLIO

They have here propertied me; keep me in darkness,send ministers to me, asses, and do all they can toface me out of my wits.

Clown

Advise you what you say; the minister is here.Malvolio, Malvolio, thy wits the heavens restore!endeavour thyself to sleep, and leave thy vainbibble babble.

MALVOLIO

Sir Topas!

Clown

Maintain no words with him, good fellow. Who, I,sir? not I, sir. God be wi' you, good Sir Topas.Merry, amen. I will, sir, I will.

MALVOLIO

Fool, fool, fool, I say!

Clown

Alas, sir, be patient. What say you sir? I amshent for speaking to you.

MALVOLIO

Good fool, help me to some light and some paper: Itell thee, I am as well in my wits as any man in Illyria.

Clown

Well-a-day that you were, sir

MALVOLIO

By this hand, I am. Good fool, some ink, paper andlight; and convey what I will set down to my lady:it shall advantage thee more than ever the bearingof letter did.

Clown

I will help you to't. But tell me true, are younot mad indeed? or do you but counterfeit?

MALVOLIO

Believe me, I am not; I tell thee true.

Clown

Nay, I'll ne'er believe a madman till I see hisbrains. I will fetch you light and paper and ink.

MALVOLIO

Fool, I'll requite it in the highest degree: Iprithee, be gone.

Clown

[Singing]I am gone, sir,And anon, sir,I'll be with you again,In a trice,Like to the old Vice,Your need to sustain;Who, with dagger of lath,In his rage and his wrath,Cries, ah, ha! to the devil:Like a mad lad,Pare thy nails, dad;Adieu, good man devil.Exit

SCENE III. OLIVIA's garden.

Enter SEBASTIAN


SEBASTIAN

This is the air; that is the glorious sun;This pearl she gave me, I do feel't and see't;And though 'tis wonder that enwraps me thus,Yet 'tis not madness. Where's Antonio, then?I could not find him at the Elephant:Yet there he was; and there I found this credit,That he did range the town to seek me out.His counsel now might do me golden service;For though my soul disputes well with my sense,That this may be some error, but no madness,Yet doth this accident and flood of fortuneSo far exceed all instance, all discourse,That I am ready to distrust mine eyesAnd wrangle with my reason that persuades meTo any other trust but that I am madOr else the lady's mad; yet, if 'twere so,She could not sway her house, command her followers,Take and give back affairs and their dispatchWith such a smooth, discreet and stable bearingAs I perceive she does: there's something in'tThat is deceiveable. But here the lady comes.Enter OLIVIA and Priest


OLIVIA

Blame not this haste of mine. If you mean well,Now go with me and with this holy manInto the chantry by: there, before him,And underneath that consecrated roof,Plight me the full assurance of your faith;That my most jealous and too doubtful soulMay live at peace. He shall conceal itWhiles you are willing it shall come to note,What time we will our celebration keepAccording to my birth. What do you say?

SEBASTIAN

I'll follow this good man, and go with you;And, having sworn truth, ever will be true.

OLIVIA

Then lead the way, good father; and heavens so shine,That they may fairly note this act of mine!Exeunt

ACT V
SCENE I. Before OLIVIA's house.

Enter Clown and FABIAN


FABIAN

Now, as thou lovest me, let me see his letter.

Clown

Good Master Fabian, grant me another request.

FABIAN

Any thing.

Clown

Do not desire to see this letter.

FABIAN

This is, to give a dog, and in recompense desire mydog again.Enter DUKE ORSINO, VIOLA, CURIO, and Lords


DUKE ORSINO

Belong you to the Lady Olivia, friends?

Clown

Ay, sir; we are some of her trappings.

DUKE ORSINO

I know thee well; how dost thou, my good fellow?

Clown

Truly, sir, the better for my foes and the worsefor my friends.

DUKE ORSINO

Just the contrary; the better for thy friends.

Clown

No, sir, the worse.

DUKE ORSINO

How can that be?

Clown

Marry, sir, they praise me and make an ass of me;now my foes tell me plainly I am an ass: so that bymy foes, sir I profit in the knowledge of myself,and by my friends, I am abused: so that,conclusions to be as kisses, if your four negativesmake your two affirmatives why then, the worse formy friends and the better for my foes.

DUKE ORSINO

Why, this is excellent.

Clown

By my troth, sir, no; though it please you to beone of my friends.

DUKE ORSINO

Thou shalt not be the worse for me: there's gold.

Clown

But that it would be double-dealing, sir, I wouldyou could make it another.

DUKE ORSINO

O, you give me ill counsel.

Clown

Put your grace in your pocket, sir, for this once,and let your flesh and blood obey it.

DUKE ORSINO

Well, I will be so much a sinner, to be adouble-dealer: there's another.

Clown

Primo, secundo, tertio, is a good play; and the oldsaying is, the third pays for all: the triplex,sir, is a good tripping measure; or the bells ofSaint Bennet, sir, may put you in mind; one, two, three.

DUKE ORSINO

You can fool no more money out of me at this throw:if you will let your lady know I am here to speakwith her, and bring her along with you, it may awakemy bounty further.

Clown

Marry, sir, lullaby to your bounty till I comeagain. I go, sir; but I would not have you to thinkthat my desire of having is the sin of covetousness:but, as you say, sir, let your bounty take a nap, Iwill awake it anon.Exit


VIOLA

Here comes the man, sir, that did rescue me.Enter ANTONIO and Officers


DUKE ORSINO

That face of his I do remember well;Yet, when I saw it last, it was besmear'dAs black as Vulcan in the smoke of war:A bawbling vessel was he captain of,For shallow draught and bulk unprizable;With which such scathful grapple did he makeWith the most noble bottom of our fleet,That very envy and the tongue of lossCried fame and honour on him. What's the matter?

First Officer

Orsino, this is that AntonioThat took the Phoenix and her fraught from Candy;And this is he that did the Tiger board,When your young nephew Titus lost his leg:Here in the streets, desperate of shame and state,In private brabble did we apprehend him.

VIOLA

He did me kindness, sir, drew on my side;But in conclusion put strange speech upon me:I know not what 'twas but distraction.

DUKE ORSINO

Notable pirate! thou salt-water thief!What foolish boldness brought thee to their mercies,Whom thou, in terms so bloody and so dear,Hast made thine enemies?

ANTONIO

Orsino, noble sir,Be pleased that I shake off these names you give me:Antonio never yet was thief or pirate,Though I confess, on base and ground enough,Orsino's enemy. A witchcraft drew me hither:That most ingrateful boy there by your side,From the rude sea's enraged and foamy mouthDid I redeem; a wreck past hope he was:His life I gave him and did thereto addMy love, without retention or restraint,All his in dedication; for his sakeDid I expose myself, pure for his love,Into the danger of this adverse town;Drew to defend him when he was beset:Where being apprehended, his false cunning,Not meaning to partake with me in danger,Taught him to face me out of his acquaintance,And grew a twenty years removed thingWhile one would wink; denied me mine own purse,Which I had recommended to his useNot half an hour before.

VIOLA

How can this be?

DUKE ORSINO

When came he to this town?

ANTONIO

To-day, my lord; and for three months before,No interim, not a minute's vacancy,Both day and night did we keep company.Enter OLIVIA and Attendants


DUKE ORSINO

Here comes the countess: now heaven walks on earth.But for thee, fellow; fellow, thy words are madness:Three months this youth hath tended upon me;But more of that anon. Take him aside.

OLIVIA

What would my lord, but that he may not have,Wherein Olivia may seem serviceable?Cesario, you do not keep promise with me.

VIOLA

Madam!

DUKE ORSINO

Gracious Olivia,--

OLIVIA

What do you say, Cesario? Good my lord,--

VIOLA

My lord would speak; my duty hushes me.

OLIVIA

If it be aught to the old tune, my lord,It is as fat and fulsome to mine earAs howling after music.

DUKE ORSINO

Still so cruel?

OLIVIA

Still so constant, lord.

DUKE ORSINO

What, to perverseness? you uncivil lady,To whose ingrate and unauspicious altarsMy soul the faithfull'st offerings hath breathed outThat e'er devotion tender'd! What shall I do?

OLIVIA

Even what it please my lord, that shall become him.

DUKE ORSINO

Why should I not, had I the heart to do it,Like to the Egyptian thief at point of death,Kill what I love?--a savage jealousyThat sometimes savours nobly. But hear me this:Since you to non-regardance cast my faith,And that I partly know the instrumentThat screws me from my true place in your favour,Live you the marble-breasted tyrant still;But this your minion, whom I know you love,And whom, by heaven I swear, I tender dearly,Him will I tear out of that cruel eye,Where he sits crowned in his master's spite.Come, boy, with me; my thoughts are ripe in mischief:I'll sacrifice the lamb that I do love,To spite a raven's heart within a dove.

VIOLA

And I, most jocund, apt and willingly,To do you rest, a thousand deaths would die.

OLIVIA

Where goes Cesario?

VIOLA

After him I loveMore than I love these eyes, more than my life,More, by all mores, than e'er I shall love wife.If I do feign, you witnesses abovePunish my life for tainting of my love!

OLIVIA

Ay me, detested! how am I beguiled!

VIOLA

Who does beguile you? who does do you wrong?

OLIVIA

Hast thou forgot thyself? is it so long?Call forth the holy father.

DUKE ORSINO

Come, away!

OLIVIA

Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.

DUKE ORSINO

Husband!

OLIVIA

       Ay, husband: can he that deny?

DUKE ORSINO

Her husband, sirrah!

VIOLA

No, my lord, not I.

OLIVIA

Alas, it is the baseness of thy fearThat makes thee strangle thy propriety:Fear not, Cesario; take thy fortunes up;Be that thou know'st thou art, and then thou artAs great as that thou fear'st.Enter Priest
O, welcome, father!Father, I charge thee, by thy reverence,Here to unfold, though lately we intendedTo keep in darkness what occasion nowReveals before 'tis ripe, what thou dost knowHath newly pass'd between this youth and me.

Priest

A contract of eternal bond of love,Confirm'd by mutual joinder of your hands,Attested by the holy close of lips,Strengthen'd by interchangement of your rings;And all the ceremony of this compactSeal'd in my function, by my testimony:Since when, my watch hath told me, toward my graveI have travell'd but two hours.

DUKE ORSINO

O thou dissembling cub! what wilt thou beWhen time hath sow'd a grizzle on thy case?Or will not else thy craft so quickly grow,That thine own trip shall be thine overthrow?Farewell, and take her; but direct thy feetWhere thou and I henceforth may never meet.

VIOLA

My lord, I do protest--

OLIVIA

O, do not swear!Hold little faith, though thou hast too much fear.Enter SIR ANDREW


SIR ANDREW

For the love of God, a surgeon! Send one presentlyto Sir Toby.

OLIVIA

What's the matter?

SIR ANDREW

He has broke my head across and has given Sir Tobya bloody coxcomb too: for the love of God, yourhelp! I had rather than forty pound I were at home.

OLIVIA

Who has done this, Sir Andrew?

SIR ANDREW

The count's gentleman, one Cesario: we took him fora coward, but he's the very devil incardinate.

DUKE ORSINO

My gentleman, Cesario?

SIR ANDREW

'Od's lifelings, here he is! You broke my head fornothing; and that that I did, I was set on to do'tby Sir Toby.

VIOLA

Why do you speak to me? I never hurt you:You drew your sword upon me without cause;But I bespoke you fair, and hurt you not.

SIR ANDREW

If a bloody coxcomb be a hurt, you have hurt me: Ithink you set nothing by a bloody coxcomb.Enter SIR TOBY BELCH and Clown
Here comes Sir Toby halting; you shall hear more:but if he had not been in drink, he would havetickled you othergates than he did.

DUKE ORSINO

How now, gentleman! how is't with you?

SIR TOBY BELCH

That's all one: has hurt me, and there's the endon't. Sot, didst see Dick surgeon, sot?

Clown

O, he's drunk, Sir Toby, an hour agone; his eyeswere set at eight i' the morning.

SIR TOBY BELCH

Then he's a rogue, and a passy measures panyn: Ihate a drunken rogue.

OLIVIA

Away with him! Who hath made this havoc with them?

SIR ANDREW

I'll help you, Sir Toby, because well be dressed together.

SIR TOBY BELCH

Will you help? an ass-head and a coxcomb and aknave, a thin-faced knave, a gull!

OLIVIA

Get him to bed, and let his hurt be look'd to.Exeunt Clown, FABIAN, SIR TOBY BELCH, and SIR ANDREW
Enter SEBASTIAN


SEBASTIAN

I am sorry, madam, I have hurt your kinsman:But, had it been the brother of my blood,I must have done no less with wit and safety.You throw a strange regard upon me, and by thatI do perceive it hath offended you:Pardon me, sweet one, even for the vowsWe made each other but so late ago.

DUKE ORSINO

One face, one voice, one habit, and two persons,A natural perspective, that is and is not!

SEBASTIAN

Antonio, O my dear Antonio!How have the hours rack'd and tortured me,Since I have lost thee!

ANTONIO

Sebastian are you?

SEBASTIAN

                  Fear'st thou that, Antonio?

ANTONIO

How have you made division of yourself?An apple, cleft in two, is not more twinThan these two creatures. Which is Sebastian?

OLIVIA

Most wonderful!

SEBASTIAN

Do I stand there? I never had a brother;Nor can there be that deity in my nature,Of here and every where. I had a sister,Whom the blind waves and surges have devour'd.Of charity, what kin are you to me?What countryman? what name? what parentage?

VIOLA

Of Messaline: Sebastian was my father;Such a Sebastian was my brother too,So went he suited to his watery tomb:If spirits can assume both form and suitYou come to fright us.

SEBASTIAN

A spirit I am indeed;But am in that dimension grossly cladWhich from the womb I did participate.Were you a woman, as the rest goes even,I should my tears let fall upon your cheek,And say 'Thrice-welcome, drowned Viola!'

VIOLA

My father had a mole upon his brow.

SEBASTIAN

And so had mine.

VIOLA

And died that day when Viola from her birthHad number'd thirteen years.

SEBASTIAN

O, that record is lively in my soul!He finished indeed his mortal actThat day that made my sister thirteen years.

VIOLA

If nothing lets to make us happy bothBut this my masculine usurp'd attire,Do not embrace me till each circumstanceOf place, time, fortune, do cohere and jumpThat I am Viola: which to confirm,I'll bring you to a captain in this town,Where lie my maiden weeds; by whose gentle helpI was preserved to serve this noble count.All the occurrence of my fortune sinceHath been between this lady and this lord.

SEBASTIAN

[To OLIVIA]  So comes it, lady, you have been mistook:But nature to her bias drew in that.You would have been contracted to a maid;Nor are you therein, by my life, deceived,You are betroth'd both to a maid and man.

DUKE ORSINO

Be not amazed; right noble is his blood.If this be so, as yet the glass seems true,I shall have share in this most happy wreck.To VIOLA
Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand timesThou never shouldst love woman like to me.

VIOLA

And all those sayings will I overswear;And those swearings keep as true in soulAs doth that orbed continent the fireThat severs day from night.

DUKE ORSINO

Give me thy hand;And let me see thee in thy woman's weeds.

VIOLA

The captain that did bring me first on shoreHath my maid's garments: he upon some actionIs now in durance, at Malvolio's suit,A gentleman, and follower of my lady's.

OLIVIA

He shall enlarge him: fetch Malvolio hither:And yet, alas, now I remember me,They say, poor gentleman, he's much distract.Re-enter Clown with a letter, and FABIAN
A most extracting frenzy of mine ownFrom my remembrance clearly banish'd his.How does he, sirrah?

Clown

Truly, madam, he holds Belzebub at the staves's end aswell as a man in his case may do: has here writ aletter to you; I should have given't you to-daymorning, but as a madman's epistles are no gospels,so it skills not much when they are delivered.

OLIVIA

Open't, and read it.

Clown

Look then to be well edified when the fool deliversthe madman.Reads
'By the Lord, madam,'--

OLIVIA

How now! art thou mad?

Clown

No, madam, I do but read madness: an your ladyshipwill have it as it ought to be, you must allow Vox.

OLIVIA

Prithee, read i' thy right wits.

Clown

So I do, madonna; but to read his right wits is toread thus: therefore perpend, my princess, and give ear.

OLIVIA

Read it you, sirrah.To FABIAN


FABIAN

[Reads]  'By the Lord, madam, you wrong me, and theworld shall know it: though you have put me intodarkness and given your drunken cousin rule overme, yet have I the benefit of my senses as well asyour ladyship. I have your own letter that inducedme to the semblance I put on; with the which I doubtnot but to do myself much right, or you much shame.Think of me as you please. I leave my duty a littleunthought of and speak out of my injury.THE MADLY-USED MALVOLIO.'

OLIVIA

Did he write this?

Clown

Ay, madam.

DUKE ORSINO

This savours not much of distraction.

OLIVIA

See him deliver'd, Fabian; bring him hither.Exit FABIAN
My lord so please you, these things furtherthought on,To think me as well a sister as a wife,One day shall crown the alliance on't, so please you,Here at my house and at my proper cost.

DUKE ORSINO

Madam, I am most apt to embrace your offer.To VIOLA
Your master quits you; and for your service done him,So much against the mettle of your sex,So far beneath your soft and tender breeding,And since you call'd me master for so long,Here is my hand: you shall from this time beYour master's mistress.

OLIVIA

A sister! you are she.Re-enter FABIAN, with MALVOLIO


DUKE ORSINO

Is this the madman?

OLIVIA

Ay, my lord, this same.How now, Malvolio!

MALVOLIO

                  Madam, you have done me wrong,Notorious wrong.

OLIVIA

                  Have I, Malvolio? no.

MALVOLIO

Lady, you have. Pray you, peruse that letter.You must not now deny it is your hand:Write from it, if you can, in hand or phrase;Or say 'tis not your seal, nor your invention:You can say none of this: well, grant it thenAnd tell me, in the modesty of honour,Why you have given me such clear lights of favour,Bade me come smiling and cross-garter'd to you,To put on yellow stockings and to frownUpon Sir Toby and the lighter people;And, acting this in an obedient hope,Why have you suffer'd me to be imprison'd,Kept in a dark house, visited by the priest,And made the most notorious geck and gullThat e'er invention play'd on? tell me why.

OLIVIA

Alas, Malvolio, this is not my writing,Though, I confess, much like the characterBut out of question 'tis Maria's hand.And now I do bethink me, it was sheFirst told me thou wast mad; then camest in smiling,And in such forms which here were presupposedUpon thee in the letter. Prithee, be content:This practise hath most shrewdly pass'd upon thee;But when we know the grounds and authors of it,Thou shalt be both the plaintiff and the judgeOf thine own cause.

FABIAN

Good madam, hear me speak,And let no quarrel nor no brawl to comeTaint the condition of this present hour,Which I have wonder'd at. In hope it shall not,Most freely I confess, myself and TobySet this device against Malvolio here,Upon some stubborn and uncourteous partsWe had conceived against him: Maria writThe letter at Sir Toby's great importance;In recompense whereof he hath married her.How with a sportful malice it was follow'd,May rather pluck on laughter than revenge;If that the injuries be justly weigh'dThat have on both sides pass'd.

OLIVIA

Alas, poor fool, how have they baffled thee!

Clown

Why, 'some are born great, some achieve greatness,and some have greatness thrown upon them.' I wasone, sir, in this interlude; one Sir Topas, sir; butthat's all one. 'By the Lord, fool, I am not mad.'But do you remember? 'Madam, why laugh you at sucha barren rascal? an you smile not, he's gagged:'and thus the whirligig of time brings in his revenges.

MALVOLIO

I'll be revenged on the whole pack of you.Exit


OLIVIA

He hath been most notoriously abused.

DUKE ORSINO

Pursue him and entreat him to a peace:He hath not told us of the captain yet:When that is known and golden time convents,A solemn combination shall be madeOf our dear souls. Meantime, sweet sister,We will not part from hence. Cesario, come;For so you shall be, while you are a man;But when in other habits you are seen,Orsino's mistress and his fancy's queen.Exeunt all, except Clown


Clown

[Sings]When that I was and a little tiny boy,With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,A foolish thing was but a toy,For the rain it raineth every day.But when I came to man's estate,With hey, ho,  & c.'Gainst knaves and thieves men shut their gate,For the rain,  & c.But when I came, alas! to wive,With hey, ho,  & c.By swaggering could I never thrive,For the rain,  & c.But when I came unto my beds,With hey, ho,  & c.With toss-pots still had drunken heads,For the rain,  & c.A great while ago the world begun,With hey, ho,  & c.But that's all one, our play is done,And we'll strive to please you every day.Exit
