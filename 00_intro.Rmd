# Introduction

This work is in progress. Until this sentence is deleted you should probably ignore everything in it.

## Overview

Dealing with text is typically not even considered in the applied statistical training of most disciplines.  This is in direct conflict with how often it has to be dealt with prior to analysis, or how interesting it might be to have text be the focus of analysis.  This document and corresponding workshop will aim to provide a sense of the things one can do with text, and the sorts of analyses that might be useful.  It must be stressed that this is only a starting point.

### Goals

The goal of this workshop is primarily to provide a sense of common tasks related to dealing with text as part of the data or the focus of analysis.  Additionally, we'll have exercises to practice.  


### Prerequisites

The document is for the most part very applied in nature, and doesn't assume much beyond familiarity with the R statistical computing environment.
